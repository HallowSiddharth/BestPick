Best for Bass lovers and light gamers .ConsLack of Application support to change the characteristics of the buds from being bass heavy to normal to trebble. Also there is no option to change from normal to low latency gaming mode.Battery lifeProsGreat battery life , about 45 hrs with case and on single charge buds goes for 4-5 hrs.ConsNo application support to show battery percentage for each bud as well as case . As sometimes I've noticed that the left bud's battery drains faster than the right bud .CallsNo cons till now as I've been looking for a bud that is great for calling and none of my friends complain about the voice quality even when I'm walking beside a busy road .So ENC works like a charm ️.Only thing that boult audio need to fix is they should come up with their app for changing the sound character of their earbuds as while on calls the other person's voice sounds too Bassy.Workaround -Although I'm using Poco F5 which has this feature to custom tune sound characters for wireless buds(added the screenshot as well) , So I can change from bass heavy sound character to trebble .

The premium material and all as boasted in the review videos, well, a glossy hard plastic doesn't mean it's premium.However, I would give it to the hard plastic it used, the metal hinges and leather cup quality, it sure is durable compared with the other headphones.Sound:I may say it's average or not so good for someone who wants genuine sound. I mean it's too much manipulated for my ears to listen this muffed up sound no matter what mode or settings I play it on.Just annoying it is as it makes no sense of having a 40mm driver to listen the muffed up sound. It may take a while for me to adjust to this sound. An custom app or something could have made it a better experience to get a customized sound profile.Comfort:These are heavy. I don't have any comparison criteria but just 40 mins of wearing these, made my ear heated and sweaty.But didn't caused any pain of any sort which is a good things I guess.The battery and mic quality, well I have a long way to explore that aspect.

Right earcup is having very less bass, sent it for warranty claim but they don't cover bass in the warranty.2. Ambient mode is also not working properly in right earcup and they also not solved this issue in warranty claim and rejected my claim.3. I use headphones for work and study but they did not meant for that, even you can't wear them for 1 hour they will cause a lot of pain in your head and around ear.4. ANC is pretty average for this price range, but comfort is  -10/5 Don't trust on YouTube reviews because i trusted on YouTube review and wasted my money.If you are thinking why i have not mentioned about sound quality i think sound quality doesn't matter when comfort is zero.My simple suggestion is if you are planning to buy over ear good ANC headphones save some more money and go for sony you will get good sony headphones under 10,000/-But don't go for this product.Update - They have finally replaced my product after 1.5 months of testing my patience.

The reviews are very polarising (either good or bad) and to my surprise neither were truly wrong. So i was skeptical but i found it on sale for 999 so i just bought it.. I will do a pros and cons first and a super detailed review after it (the review will be given keeping the price range of 1500-2000 in mind)Pros:- Build Quality- Sound Quality (after EQ) [Amazing Bass, crystal clear and lively vocals with ear-fatigue free & nice treble tones]- Battery Life- Dual Connectivity and stable connection- No noticeable latency in videos- Comfort- Sick RGBCons:- Mic Quality-Sound Quality (without EQ) [Amazing Bass, Bad vocals, Bad treble tones]-Low battery indications every 60 secs after 20% (didn't say 1 min as people might take it as an exaggeration)- You cant change or keep 1 colour on rgb, it changes on its own- Few Service Centres- Sometimes the headphones goes into a weird state where you have to keep the power button pressed for 10-30 seconds for it to work againMinor cons (which are completely fine for the price but are worth mentioning)-the rgb also turns on each time you power on the headphone so turning it off for more battery gets a bit annoying-The earcups dont fold (if you want to keep them on your neck then you will have to extend them , after that they wont restrict your head movement)-Each time you start/turn off the headphones or it connects/disconnects there is a voice announcement which i found to be quite annoyingDETAILED REVIEW1) Build Quality: The headband is made of made up of metal and looks very sturdy. The plastic used on the earcups is also of a good quality and i don't think it will break easily. The wire that is visible is thick and i aint worried about it. The earcups dont fold (which i knew) but it could have been a good addition.  The cushioning on the headband is minimal but soft so you wont have a problem there. The ear cushions are very soft. Dimensions of entire ear cushion 10cm x 8cm . Dimensions of the opening for our ears 5.6cm x 4cm.The buttons wobble a little bit in their place but are clicky & tactile. The box it comes in, is very Sturdy and can be used to keep the headphone.2) Looks: The headphone has a sick matte black colour which i love, the side profile looks amazing, it does look a bit bulky and weird when you look at it from the front though.3) Comfort:  I thought the hole should be as big as my ear to be comfortable which was not the case, my ear is like 6 cm and it still fits inside (with unnoticeable bending as the hole does get a bit bigger inside due to the pressure of our earlobes against it). The headphone does not feel heavy at all. The clamping force is just enough to keep the headphone from slipping, it isn't much which increases the comfort. The earcup wobbles a bit for a comfortable angle on your head. The clicks to increase or decrease the size are tight so the size wont change when you shake your head. I didn't have any discomfort wearing it for 4-5 hours straight. Although, the ears do sweat after 2-3 hours in normal temperature so you have to take a break of 2 mins (it doesnt feel warm but the sweat can speed up the wear and tear of the ear cushions. the way i do it is to just let out the air inside the headphones every once in like 30 mins for 15 secs which is much more efficient)Note: If its your first time wearing an over ear headphone then it might take a couple of days to get used to the weight and clamping force. Also, like all over ear headphones, they will be tight out of the box but they will loosen up after several hours of use (you can just put it on a pillow in between the earcushions instead if your head overnight)4) Battery Life: I think it goes upto 20-22 hours on higher volumes (can be used only till 20% is left, after that unusable due to voice alerts)5) Charging Time: Takes about 1hr 45 mins to go from 20% to 100%6) Connectivity: I tried going into another room and it worked just fine so don't worry about the range. This headphone has dual connectivity which isn't mentioned anywhere, you can connect with 2 devices and if you play something with 1 device, the other pauses and vice versa7) Latency: There is no noticeable latency in most videos or movies (there is a very slight delay which you can notice if you try noticing it hard but you wont do that while watching anything so its safe to say there is no noticeable latency, the latency can also be noticed if the person talks really fast)8) Gaming: When you do gaming via bluetooth you will notice the latency like pretty much every wireless product without a gaming mode of 80ms latency. You can make out where the sound is coming from pretty easily. You can use the aux to get 0 latency.9) Mic: The mic is straight up bad, lacks both clarity and loudness (Do note that the mic won't work with the aux cable)10) Sound Isolation: You can't really hear anything of outside if something is playing in your headphones. If the volume is loud the people around you can hear it which is a con, other headphones do a better job here11) Sound Quality (without EQ): The bass is very powerful, perfect for bass lovers but the mids and highs aren't even good12) Sound Quality (with basic EQ):The Sound is loud enough at 100% for pretty much anyone who does not have significant hearing loss. The bass can be made less powerful or even more powerful if you want to blast your skull with the bass. The mids are produced very nicely. The highs are on point (neither sharp nor dull, its sparky enough without causing ear fatigue). The clarity is also very nice, the sounds seems crystal clear and crispy The distortion is very less.(Note: My Basic EQ is just take the little dots in the right half and increase all of them to some extent, keep the leftmost dot where it was and try to make a straight line between the leftmost and middle dots with the other dots left in the left half). One thing to note is that, you will find that the headphone skipped a word, its random and not that often but its worth mentioning13) Sound quality via aux: The same things apply here but the max volume is 90% of what it was via bluetooth and the clarity gets a boost if you play FLAC format music1 Year Edit for Durability: Everything still stands true, the earcup vinyl (i think that is the material) startedcoming off suddenly after 10 months i think and now its gone but it doesnt make a difference to sound or comfort. It randomly stopped working, i think the power button disconnected so i sent them via courier to the service centre (in warranty) and they sent it back in a week i think. I dropped them twice from 3 feet and it stayed fine, but someone sat on my headphones and one side got de-attached from the headband held on just by wire, it then dropped twice after that and that one side stopped working. I tried contacting service centres about how much the repair will cost so that i dont end up spending 400 or something to get this headphone repaired when i bought it for 999 but they didnt respond so i can spend either 100 to get this to the service centre by courier (most companies have a pick up service like soundcore) or go 20km away to get it repaired myself (which is hard during covid). Do Check if there are service centres around you before you get a zeb product.\nRead more", '\nIt\'s been a year since I ordered this, headphones were pretty good lasted for a year n around tho I faced few glitches with Bluetooth connectivity near the last months of use.Mic wasn\'t the best "kamchalau"RGB lights look good, they r quite bulky and the cup size might look weirdSound quality was good as per the price, never hurted my braincells or ears\nRead more', '\nI am Using this product since two weeks for 3-4 hours daily and came up with this conclusion.Pros:1.

And for audio volume level, It gives hearable sound in just 18% of computer audio and when i increase audio upto 100 i can hear even the base from 40cm far from the headphones.As for comfort The cushions are really good, i was able to keep it on ears for 3hrs but not more than that cause it mae my head feel dizzy cause of hearing all my favourate melodies, old school, hip hop, rap and metal songs all at once LOL, But like other headphones i bought this one is stiff and feels like it will break if pressurised to stretch .As for looks I love the RGB and the grill metal look it gives is DOPE along with plastic matte cover. It is quiet big like having two black and glowing eggs attached to ears but its worth cause the big egg things has lot of BASS inside LOL.The battery life is incredible, I have been using it since yesterday and it still have 50% battery left.ONLY PROBLEM is that I found the audio has sharp voice somewhat maximised to keep up with that heavy bass, like when you hear a song you will hear the vocals in sharp voice which is not actually pleasant. I counter this problem by using an equilizer in phone and laptop by decreasing the 14 KHz to some level and increasing 910 Hz to some level. And it only happens in bluetooth mode, The aux is perfect though.Apart from all this I love my new headphone, Zebronics done a fabulous job by making it and selling it in such an affordable price.\nRead more', "\nSound is good for the price, bass is adequate and volume is high enough but overall looking at the sound quality, it feels crappy and very low quality.

I got this for around 4999 INR, and for the price it fits my use case perfectly.Pretty comfortable on the head, but I\'ve not used super high-end headphones either but this can easily remain on your head without any discomfort for 1-2 hours at a stretch. Although because of the material used on the earcups, you might feel a bit sweaty and hot around your ears if you\'re in a hot environment (happened to me a couple of times, but it\'s not too much of an issue).The sound quality is fine. Again, I\'m not going to pretend to be an audiophile, but it does seem to be tuned for the Bass-ier sounds than an even sound. Music is great, but doesn\'t do voices as well but it\'s definitely above average and great for the price.The connectivity is great. I love dual-pairing and the fast-pair functionality. Although I do have some issues with how unpredictably it falls asleep when not in use - sometimes even when it\'s not in use, it\'ll stay on for the whole night, and sometimes it\'ll fall asleep when not in use for 10-15 mins. But it might be something with the way I\'m using it. I have it paired to 2 devices all the time.The battery life is great for me, use it for 4-5 hours in a day, and lasts about a week. Charges pretty fast too. Top up for 10 mins will get an hour or two of listening. (but read the noise cancellation section also)The build quality is average or leaves a little to be desired. It feels very cheap, but more importantly, the first thought I had when I picked it up was that "It feels really fragile" and that it will break if I so much as look at it the wrong way. Sometimes, you hear the plastic creaking when you put it on or take it off (Yikes)The noise cancellation is just bad. It makes a marginal difference to the listening experience, and only blocks out really low sounds (the fan, AC and other low humming sounds) but does not do anything to anything more than that, if it\'s raining you\'ll very likely be able to hear the rain clearly.You\'ll still be able to hear people perfectly, sometimes even clearer than without the NC one as it blocks out other ambient noises lmao. and it seems to have this \'directional\' problem where it\'s great it cancelling sounds coming from infront of you, but not so much for things coming from the sides and behind.But don\'t get this for the NC, just pretend it\'s not there. Also because the NC cuts down the battery life to almost half the normal use with a minimal upgrade to listening experience.Although they advertise it as foldable and it can indeed be folded into a smaller size. It feels even more fragile in the folded position and the folded position decreased the total area used by around 30-40% only. Not worth folding.The last thing I hate is the wired connection. For some weird reason, it\'s not a 3.5mm to 3.5mm aux jack like you would normally see. It\'s a weird 2.5mm to 3.5mm connector. So if you want to connect it like that, make sure you carry around the bundled cable they give.\nRead more', '\nThis is my review of JBL Tune 710BT after one year of purchase.This was my first headphone purchase. I have only used earphones before. I\'m writing this because I\'m unsure what to expect for this price. I bought them for Rs.4000. In this one year, I can say that I have used these headphones a lot and have a few points to say about it.Pros -1. Battery life - They mention it\'s 50 hrs and it is. I have completed the series "Peaky Blinders" on a single charge with 20% battery remaining. That\'s some next-level battery life, considering the driver\'s size.2. Sound quality - The sound quality (excluding the bass) is pretty good, what some would say is a classic JBL signature.3. Comfort - It is very comfortable. As I said, I come from an earphone background, so it took a while to get used to it.4. Dual-device connectivity - This feature is a blessing and works effortlessly. But it only works effortlessly on Windows. I have an Android (Samsung) phone and tried connecting it with Windows(10/11) and Linux (Debian) systems as well. I faced some hiccups on the Linux side, but that can be due to incompatible audio drivers.5. Charging Speed - It takes more than an hour to charge from 0 to 100. But a quick 10-minute charge can last for hours.Cons -1. Sound quality (Bass) - It\'s too low. You can feel it only at higher volumes (>85%).2. Built quality - I don\'t know if I can expect a well-built headphone at Rs.4000. It is comfortable, but after a few hours of continuous usage, my ear gets sweaty, and I have to remove them for a few minutes. And all of this from staying indoors. DO NOT use this outdoors for jogging or running or at the gym. I tried my best to keep them away from sweat or wet hair, but as you can see from the photos, the leather (or whatever that material is) starts to deteriorate. The stitching of the right ear cup suddenly gave up one day. I tried to fix it using fevicol (glue), and you can see how they look from the photos.3. Over-the-ear - It is not over the ear. I have tried a few over-the-ear headphones, and this is not it. I think I have a decent-sized ear, and the rims of my ear touch and sometimes get folded by the inner cushion of the ear cups of this headphone. These are a little bit smaller to be called over-the-ear headphones.Conclusions -1. Don\'t buy this if you sweat a lot or plan to take this outdoors.2. Don\'t expect bass from it. My Rs.500 earphone (Realme Buds 2) has more bass than this.3. Other than bass, the sound is good.4. They are not fully Over-the-ear. So, some people might feel uncomfortable.5. A decent pair of headphones, but I expected a better-built quality for Rs.4000.\nRead more', "\nLet me rate this product first on different parameters.• Sound Quality - 4/5• Comfort - 5/5 (This is subjective as everybody has different ear and head sizes. It fits perfectly one me like an over the ear headphone.)• Bass - 3/5• Bluetooth connectivity - 5/5• Noice Cancellation - 2/5• Treble - Low and mid trebles were flat but highs were good.If you are addicted to bass then you will be more or less disappointed (Now, this doesn't mean that they don't have any bass). The USP of this headphone is- balance. It balances everything out.Overall I am impressed with this Tune 710BT. A few days ago I ordered Tune 510BT, and everything was according to my liking, but the problem was that those were 'on ear' headphone, and hence they were painful. So, I ordered these 'over the ear' ones and I am thoroughly impressed.Although, bass and low trebles could have been better and fair price should have been under 3k rather than 4k.We have got to understand that these are an entry level/cheap headsets for a brand like JBL.\nRead more", '\nO fone é realmente muito bom e, apesar de não ter cancelamento ativo de ruído, a construção dele faz com que quando você o coloque ele abafe consideravelmente barulhos externos e isso foi uma surpresa bastante positiva, pois fones com cancelamento ativo de ruído são bem mais caros e esse, só com a espuma na orelha e o ajuste dele, supre um pouquinho disso. Por conta dessa característica, algumas pessoas podem achar que ele aperta muito. Bom, ele aperta, mas na minha opinião, apenas um pouco, não é muito a ponto de ser desconfortável a longo prazo, é um aperto "padrão" para esses fones sem fio.O som dele é incrível, como já era de se esperar da JBL. Tem um volume ótimo, sem precisar estar sempre no máximo e tem graves e agudos incríveis. E a bateria? DURA MUITOOOO! Eu uso ele todo dia, num uso médio e ele dura mais de 4 dias a bateria fácil e para carregar, não cheguei a contar quanto tempo, mas também carrega super rápido (como eu disse, não cheguei a contar mas pela minha baixíssima percepção de tempo, parece ter sido uns 10 min kkkkkkkkkk). A construção física do fone também parece ótima, não tem nada "balançando", solto, ou algo do tipo. Tudo parece estar onde deveria estar.Entretanto, algumas considerações que pode desagradar alguns mas para mim, até agora, que já tô usando a mais de um mês, está tudo ok, tudo normal: A capinha que reveste a espuma que vai na orelha parece ser um "saquinho plástico bem vagabundo", como se fosse rasgar logo logo mas até agora está tudo certo, nada de ruim aconteceu. O cabo para carregamento (USB tipo C) entra só até a metade nele e parece que esse é o normal, pois não entra mais do que isso e carrega normalmente, mas com certeza é estranho (até pq a gente fica com vontade de forçar para entrar um pouco mais). Se você usar ele ligado, mas a um certo tempo sem estar tocando nada (+10 min), ele começa a dar um leve zumbidinho, bem bem baixinho no lado direito. Não sei se é só o meu, mas acontece isso.Por último, eu comprei ele para ser meu fone para tudo, inclusive para eu usar nas aulas online do Google Meet, falando e ouvindo, entretanto, flopou totalmente pq a internet fica muito ruim quando usamos ele no Meet, eu não sei por quê, mas é inviável assistir aula por ele pq fica direto caindo e não dá nem pra abrir outras páginas no computador, mas assim que você o desliga, tudo volta magicamente a funcionar bem. É estranho pois uso ele na TV em plataformas de streaming de filmes, uso ele no celular para tudo, uso ele no notebook para YouTube enquanto faço milhares de outras coisas no computador e não tem nenhum problema, mas se eu abrir o Google Meet o uso da internet no Notebook fica imprestável se estiver usando esse fone.\nRead more', '\nBom, como não vi ninguém aqui relatar o que eu vivi com esse produto, me sinto na obrigação de comunicar aquelas variáveis  sobre o produto que você só descobre com o tempo e pela repetição dos mesmos impasses e armadilhas nas três ocasiões em que comprei. Isso já virou uma saga. Essa foi a terceira vez que eu comprei um JBL sem fio. Os dois primeiros ainda eram o de 500, e há seis meses atrás comprei esse do 510. Pois bem, venho aqui seis meses depois relatar o que só os usuários intensivos descobrem: que esta porcaria tem uma obsolescência programada monstruosa. A razão pela qual eu já comprei TRÊS VEZES fones da JBL ao longo dos últimos três anos é que, em todos esses casos, passados alguns meses, a bateria se suicida, ou então o fone não liga, ou qualquer erro aleatório começa a dinamitar a possibilidade de utilizá-lo. Ou seja, tudo é lindo e maravilhoso, desde que você use pouco, porque a vida útil dele é ridiculamente curta.Não me levem a mal, se eu comprei três vezes é porque todo o resto é fantástico: o som grave é quase imperial, a bateria, quando ainda funciona, é colossal nesse 510 e muito acima da concorrência.Entretanto, é isso que eu preciso vir falar aqui: toda essa lua de mel funciona para quem usa pouco, para quem usa de forma intensiva, você esbarra claramente no limite da obsolescência programada do produto: míseros meses são o suficiente pro aparelho se suicidar, não querer ligar, a bateria pular de 50% pra 0% sem razão alguma, etc. Isso não deveria acontecer, haja vista que até celular dura muito mais do que isso sem ficar inutilizável. O que adianta  JBL fazer um fone fantástico se esse "fantástico" dura 5 meses? Este último foi a gota d\'água, foi a compra foi feita no dia 28 de janeiro de 2022 e esta desgraça já está ruim agora, no início de agosto. Até os produtos anteriores da marca tinham durado mais que isso. Enfim, essa é a situação dialética que os usuários tem de ser informados: sim, ele é ótimo, colossal, mas essa lua de mel tem uma vida útil muito reduzida. Antes eu pensava que era problema da unidade que eu comprei, algo de exceção, mas passadas três vezes que comprei o produto e em todas elas acontece isso, já vemos um padrão.\nRead more', '\nPuedo realizar una comparación de este modelo  JBL T760BTNC con\xa0\nSony WH-XB910N EXTRA BASS\n\xa0que también los tengo y pertenecen ambos a la misma gama de sonido. En general sin entrar en muchas especificaciones me han parecido unos buenos auriculares que al precio que están aquí en Amazon me parecen correctos y son una buena oferta en mi opinión no llegando a los 90 euros actualmente.Valorando la calidad que tiene la presentación y los propios auriculares en si, me parecen que llegan con una buena presentación y la calidad en general de los auriculares son de este tipo de gama, pesan muy poco, son muy cómodos y te atrapa toda la oreja por lo que la inmersión en el sonido está muy bien.La calidad que tiene las almohadillas me parecen mejores que los Sony de los que hablo, ya que estos, se me han deteriorado muy rápidamente, aunque existen recambios y se pueden cambiar fácilmente, algo que en los JBL desconozco por el momento si es posible.SONIDO.En cuanto al sonido en si, es cierto que tienen sonidos distintos, los JBL no tienen unos graves muy pronunciados, algo que se puede mejorar con un ecualizado por software pero el equilibrio que tiene me parece acertado para personas que no quieran tener siempre un zumbido en la cabeza con los graves, es decir equilibrio entre medios y agudos y bajos no muy altos, como he dicho se pueden mejorar con un software de ecualización. Aquí, personalmente, los Sony tienen más cuerpo en general, pensado quizás para una música que tenga unos bajos muy pronunciados, hip hop, pop, etc, sin embargo con música como metal personalmente los tengo que bajar por lo que creo que tienen un punto superior a estos JBL.CANCELACIÓN DE RUIDO.Ambos tienen un muy buen sistema de cancelación de sonido activa, excelentes aunque los JBL necesitan un punto más alto de volumen para sentirte totalmente aislado y creo que en este caso el sistema de Sony los supera, no por mucho, pero si en reducción.En ambos casos no escucho ruidos molestos ni sonidos demasiados agudos como me ocurre con otros Jabra que tengo, que nos lo comparo porque pertenecen a otra gama más elevada. En definitiva buena cancelación de sonido.SOFTWAREAquí es un punto que no entiendo, los JBL TUNE760NC no son compatibles con la aplicación JBL Headphones, no podemos por lo tanto ecualizarlos ni configurarlos a nuestro gusto, sin embargo los Sony WH-XB910N, si. No suele ser importante para personas que simplemente quieran unos auriculares para escuchar música, hablar por teléfono etc, pero para mi es un punto importante siendo de esta gama de auriculares.COMODIDAD.Son realmente cómodos, no pesan en absoluto y las almohadillas son blandas y por ahora no se deforman ni se están deteriorando. En la diadema superior no tiene ningún tipo de apoyo o aporte para poder amortiguar la presión, pero en general son muy cómodos.CONCLUSIÓN.Me han parecido unos buenos auriculares, dentro de la gama que estamos hablando lo esperado en sonido, quizás si buscas unos bajos potentes estos no sean los tuyos, si busca algo equilibrado puede ser una buena opción a tener en cuenta.Que no tenga soporte por aplicación es algo que no termina de gustarme personalmente, pero en general considero que al precio que los he comprado a la fecha de escribir esta opinión están bastante bien para usuario no muy exigentes los considero unos buenos auriculares. Para más exigentes hay que irse a otras gamas más elevadas.Espero que esta opinión te haya servido de ayuda,\nRead more', '\nO produto chegou antes do esperado, parabéns Total Express e Amazon!

Dá para ouvir e sair andando pela casa sem estar perto do celular, ah isola o som ambiente até que bem, minha mãe gritou e eu nem ouvi! :) Quando liguei tive dificuldade para conectar com mais de um aparelho (um de cada vez, é claro), primeiro liguei conectei com o iPad e funcionou, aí desconectei e tentei conectar com o celular Samsung e não reconhecia, aí tentei com o notebook Sony Vaio e também não ia. Fiquei com raiva e achava que era defeito, cheguei até abrir uma reclamação e iria devolver…. Imagina ;( … Tentei baixar App da JbL e ainda fui no site, nada, procurei no manual e nada! Até que tentei no Google! Google salva vidas! Achei um vídeo que falava que ia resolver o problema de forma simples, e assim o fez! Era apenas um probleminha de configuração, onde vc tem que restaurar a configuração para a de fábrica apertando (segurar o botão durante 30 segundos, mais ou menos) os botões + e - ao mesmo tempo até que a luz branca dele mude para cor azul e comece a piscar, pronto feito isso ele conectou em tudo! A única coisa chata é que tenho que repetir esse processo toda vez que vou mudar de aparelho conectado!

Qualidade de som e microfone boas para uso cotidiano, o isolamento não é total, mas pra mim não é um problema.O material é excelente, super articulado e o tecido que recobre as almofadas é tipo um courino, fácil de limpar e após meses utilizando continua como se fosse novo. Uma simples limpeza com pano úmido e detergente neutro é o suficiente.Sofro com fones que apertam a cabeça, e este modelo não me causa dor. Consigo utilizar por horas a fio sem nenhum desconforto.A duração da bateria é absurdamente boa. Não é possível utilizar o fone enquanto carrega, mas tem a opção de utilizar um plugue de entrada 3mm que acompanha o fone. A recarga é super rápida.A conexão com outros aparelhos é simples, e consigo conectar a mais de um aparelho ao mesmo tempo. Utilizo com celular e notebook e eles alternam de forma automática à medida que um e outro emitem sons.Por último faço uma comparação com o fone modelo 510BT (também da JBL): este modelo 710BT é muito superior. O outro já está com cara de velho, qualidade de som inferior e aperta muito a cabeça e o tecido que recobre o fone é de qualidade inferior e difícil de limpar.Recomendo demais este modelo, compraria novamente de olhos fechados.\nRead more']}{'title': '        (Refurbished) JBL Tune 760NC, Over Ear Active Noise Cancellation Bluetooth Headphones with Mic, up to 50 Hours Playtime, JBL Pure Bass, Google Fast Pair, Dual Pairing, AUX (Black)       ', 'reviews': ['\nBulid quality is good but sound not satisfied\nRead more', '\nsound quality is not that good as expected from a brand like JBL .

The headphones were awesome, seemed like brand new in the beginning. For the first two months worked very well but yea i couldn't charge it beyond 60% but it worked for abt 50 hours so i thought it was a software bug. Then the battery would drop like crazy when i used the noise cancelling feature which i didn't mind since i rarely used it. At about 5 months mark it randomly stopped working, like it used to switch off automatically when turned on. Took it to a jbl service center but they said they wont work with renewed/refurbished products. Came back to amazon customer service and after submitting several proofs they finally agreed for a replacement/refund. Seriously would have been screwed if it malfunctioned after the 6 month mark when seller warrenty becomes voidHowever the product is insanely good so will recommend anyone to buy the original one rather than going for the renewed ones. I am skeptical of service center folks coz in my experince if a product fails even in its warranty period service center ppl go with juggad rather than fully fixing it but jbl has good service centers.

Keep in mind that the music sounds different with noise cancelling on and if you listen to music at volume greater than 80% then it switches off noise cancelling. More or less noise cancelling won't make a difference if you are at home and there are people chatting in the living room....I use the headphones for ~10 to 12 hours a day and it reaches 50% after a day's useage with noise cancelling on for half the time.

On the one hand, they excel in terms of features and audio quality, but on the other, their long-term durability is a significant concern when it comes to the wired version.First, let's discuss the positive aspects. The Samsung earphones come packed with features that enhance the listening experience. The sound quality is impressive, delivering crisp and clear audio across a wide range of frequencies. They also offer great noise isolation, which is perfect for shutting out the outside world and immersing yourself in your music or podcasts.The earphones are comfortable to wear for extended periods, and they fit securely in your ears, which is a big plus for active individuals or commuters. The in-line microphone and remote control make it easy to manage calls and playback without reaching for your phone, adding convenience to your daily routine.However, the Achilles' heel of these earphones is their durability, especially when it comes to the wired version. Over time, I found that the wires tend to fray and weaken, leading to audio issues and sometimes complete loss of functionality. It's disappointing to see such a great product compromised by the relatively short lifespan of the wires.If you're considering purchasing these Samsung earphones, I'd strongly recommend the wireless version for better durability. While they come at a higher price point, they eliminate the wire-related durability concerns and provide a more extended period of reliable usage.In conclusion, the Samsung earphones offer excellent audio quality and a range of features that enhance the listening experience. However, if you opt for the wired version, be prepared for potential durability issues with the wires over time. For a more lasting and hassle-free experience, the wireless option may be the way to go.\nRead more", '\nVery good product in this price range, good sound, fit for ear comfort.

The built quality is amazing, all around it's plastic with foam on the headband but it's very sturdy, the headband is not too loose, slightly tight but it does loosen up a bit eventually2. Comfort - The ear foams are ok/meh but do feel a little uncomfortable after like 2 or 3 hrs, and not much ventilation so It might a get a little hot during the summers3. Mic - The mic is also pretty good, it does a poor job filtering surrounding noise, you wouldn't be able to hear the noise but it lowers your sound4. Sound Quality - I'm not an audiphile but the sound is also good, not too high of a bass but it gets pretty loud without bleeding5. Latency - There isn't much latency or any latency at all that I noticed while daily use, ie on YouTube, media play etc, but there is a significant lag when gaming SO DON'T BUY THIS FOR GAMING6. Connectivity- Connectivity is also ok but not too great, the connection breaks and after like 5,6 seconds it reconnects automatically, it doesn't happen too often but it does happen usually after long hours of usage7. Battery Life - battery Life is pretty good, I can go 3 days without charging with pretty heavy usage, the battery indication (in the app) is a little off though,meaning it might show 100% within 15-20 mins of charging but the battery drains quickly, you gotta let it charge for an additional 20/30 mins after hitting 100% for the battery to actually be full8. Range- The range is not bad, nothing crazy, around 5 to 6 meters9.

The product is a bit tricky to setup with the app and you have to follow YouTube videos to get it setup. I wish Xiaomi provides video tutorial links in their user manuals. They don\'t mention it but we need Bluetooth and WiFi connection to be setup, for the app and robot  to work together. This tip is missing in user manual.2. WiFi connectivity does get lost sometimes but that is because my router is far from certain places in my house. That time the robot needs to be brought back to the WiFi range. 5GHz connection does not work with this model.3. The robot takes anywhere between 40-60 minutes to completely vaccum my 800 sq. ft house. Battery life is really good in the new model. 50% or more is still left after one complete sweep or mop cycle of my house. Charging is also not bad. It took 1.5 hrs for it to charge full 100% the first time.4. Couple of times it got confused in a specific area in my house and I had to reset the entire house map for it to work properly again. Once the map was created and the device has sweeped and mopped that area for a couple of times, it would not repeat this behavior.5. Dusting is of A1 quality. Each time the amount of dust collected is staggering. We never knew we had so much dust in our house!6. Mopping is average. I would call it "light wiping" and not mopping. Hard stains or sticky stains or dry stains are not affected by the mopping. Only light dust or weak stickiness gets wiped out. Adding a bit of floor cleaning liquid or Vim liquid in the water helps.7. Vacuum + Mop mixed mode is limited in its effectiveness. In this mode, mopping sometimes wets the floor and causes dry dust to stick to the floor which the vaccum is not able to pick up.I recommend vacuum and mop as two separate cycles.8. Keeping mop extension attached to the robot all the time causes mopping cloth to accumulate dirt, and when it gets dragged along the floor it causes wet dirty mop to be wiped around the house. This is not ideal. So it\'s important to remove that extension from the vacuum bot when you are only vacuuming and not mopping.9. The mop works horribly on door mats (main door or bathroom mats). It gets very dirty when it moves over mats and then that wet dirt spreads all over the place. So please remove all the mats, esp. during mopping session.10. Noise levels are pretty low in medium mode. Sometimes we don\'t even know where it has gone, it gets so quiet.Pros.* Battery life* Suction power* Noise levels* VacuumingCons* Mopping is average. It\'s at best can be called as light wiping.* Setup is bit tricky, user manual is insufficient. Xiaomi does not contact or send any demo person at home. You have to figure it out using YouTube videos. I can see old people or non tech savvy people will highly struggle with this thing.* Once the device is confused it doesn\'t correct itself automatically. It needs a map reset.* Door mats make the mop even dirtier so please remove them or other items on the floor before mopping.Such tips nobody gives you and you have to learn them on your own.But I still recommend this device as it is very effective in sweeping the dust in the house clean.\nRead more', "\nThis is going to be detailed review.I was using first version of MI Robo Mop in the past and this is my upgrade from Old version to new version. There is definitely lot of improvement from previous version to latest version and it is for better.Suction capacity is increased, it means that there is better dust cleaning capacity.LDS Navigation is increased, it means that there is less travel within the house and there by effeciency increased.Increased dust tank capacity - I'm cleaning tank less often then previous version. Previous one we have to clean the tank every 2-3 days, latest one I'm cleaning it for 3-4 days.One more major improvement I observed in the app settings for the latest version. There are lot of customizable options provided which can be setup as per our needs. Attaching screenshots.In latest version there is no need to start entire home cleaning for creating map. There is option to create map without cleaning and mop will scan the rooms and creates maps for you, which I think is one of the major change and I liked it very much.My final verdict is if you are looking for budget Robo Vaccum then Mop 2 pro is best option and if you are using previous version upgrade to this version and you find it better in lot many ways.I got it for ₹23,999 which is super deal price during Amazon great Indian festival.\nRead more", '\nI purchased the device a month ago, and I must say, it has significantly lightened the cleaning workload for my mother in our 1300 sq ft house. This device is incredibly easy to program and use, making it a convenient addition to our household chores. While it has its limitations, overall, it has proven to be a good buy.One of the standout features of this vacuum robot is its user-friendly interface. Programming it is a breeze, allowing us to effortlessly schedule cleaning sessions according to our needs. Its performance has been commendable, efficiently navigating through our home and leaving no corner untouched. The device lives up to its promises and delivers the expected results. At times, it\'s confused. But again, it\'s easy to bring it back to its senses.Maintaining the vacuum robot is also hassle-free, as it is easy to clean. This saves us valuable time and ensures that the device remains in optimal working condition. The customer service during the installation process was decent, providing a satisfactory and convenient experience.However, the mopping feature of the robot falls short of expectations. While it can effectively be used once a week, the frequent refilling required to cover our entire house is inconvenient. It demands at least three refills, which can become tiresome over time. Although it serves its purpose, there is room for improvement in this aspect.Additionally, the battery life of the vacuum robot could have been better. While it is sufficient to clean the house twice on a single charge, an extended battery life would have been appreciated. However, it is worth noting that the suction power of the device is exceptional. I have never seen the floors so clean in ages, and it truly justifies the purchase.On the downside, despite offering four different modes, including a "silent" option, I was disappointed to find that it did not live up to its name. The noise level remained nearly identical to the "Standard" mode, which was unexpected. It would have been ideal if the "silent" mode truly provided a quieter operation, allowing the device to clean the house without disturbing the peace. Unfortunately, it fell short in this aspect.Nevertheless, considering the impressive suction power and the overall effectiveness in cleaning, I still believe that this vacuum robot is worth the purchase. It efficiently reduces the workload, leaves the floors spotless, and offers convenient programming and scheduling options. Despite the minor flaws, the benefits outweigh the drawbacks, making it a worthy investment for a cleaner home.Furthermore, it is worth mentioning that my mother, who is over 60 years old, has been able to handle and use the vacuum robot without any issues. Its user-friendly design caters to different age groups and abilities, making it accessible for individuals like her.In conclusion, this vacuum robot has been a valuable addition to our household, significantly reducing the cleaning workload and providing convenience. However, the limitations of the mopping feature and the questionable value for money prevent me from giving it a full endorsement.\nRead more', '\nEasy to use can be controlled easily by app and adding virtual wall is useful..Cleaning is good .One star less as dor some small items stick while vacuuming so we have to work around before it takes round\nRead more']}{'title': '        AGARO Regal 800 Watts Handheld Vacuum Cleaner,For Home Use,Dry Vacuuming,6.5 Kpa Suction Power,Lightweight,Lightweight&Durable Body,Small/Mini Size ( Black),0.8 Liter,Cloth       ', 'reviews': ["\nI've been using this for a few months now.

Since I had tried to use it, I didn't think it would qualify for a return.  I left a review about the overheating, and was really (pleasantly) surprised that the seller reached out to me about the problems on their own initiative.  They were really polite, asked a few questions about the problems I was having, and then offered to replace or refund my purchase.  They processed the refund in under an hour.  I wanted to come back and update the review to reflect the customer service in my rating- the device has a lot of positive reviews, so I assume mine was just a fluke, and for the price, it's a really nice kit with more than the usual standard accessories (the booklet especially was nice bc I had no idea what each head was technically supposed to do).Had I not bought another grinder before I talked to them, I would have taken the exchange (they didn't even ask me to send the original one back), just bc the rest of the reviews were overwhelmingly positive.  A company that stands behind their product says a lot more about their business ethos than a single dud product. At no point did they ask me to change my review; the replacement/refund offer was genuinely them just standing behind their product and customers, which is why I did want to update it.  It's definitely one of the nicer kits at this price point, and I would definitely give it another shot if I need to replace the one I bought after theirs in the future.Original review:It came with a lot of accoutrements - two different sets of grinding heads (each in their own case), a large baggie of sanding bands (which are only used for one grinder head, so they will definitely last you awhile), the device itself, and a booklet that explains what each grinder head is used for, with trouble shooting tips and a six month warranty if you complete the registration process (it's explained in the last section of the booklet).  The device also comes with a cable and built in adapter; the cord is fairly long but you do need to keep it plugged in while using.Unfortunately, my device kept heating up within 30 seconds of turning it on.  It's all metal, so it got too hot to even hold.  The cord has an on/off switch, and a forward/reverse switch. It plugs into the bottom of your device like a head jack, and the adapter goes into an electrical outlet.  The drill bits/grinder heads basically attach by pushing them in, then twisting a tiny bit at the end. I had some issues with the device turning on and off- some of the drill bits/grinder heads didn't seem to connect, while others were a bit less twitchy.  Between that and the overheating, I couldn't really use it.The booklet specs say that the input voltage range is 100-240 V (50/60Hz), and the output is DC 12V 1A.  Our outlets are only 120 volts (which is the norm for regular household outlets, stateside, while larger utilities like washers and dryers, refrigerators, etc are higher).  I tried it on several different outlets, but the device overheats on all of them.  The device should not be overheating since I am well below the voltage limit. In other words, this was definitely caused by the internal wiring of the device itself.\nRead more", '\nGood value if you replacements included quality held up well only other way of where to order more chips to replace the files worn out.\nRead more', '\nOverall I like the device and think it works well. It takes some time and practice to work it efficiently. The only reason I gave four stars is that I wish the controls were on the actual handheld part and not in the middle of the power cord.
