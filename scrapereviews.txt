Best for Bass lovers and light gamers .ConsLack of Application support to change the characteristics of the buds from being bass heavy to normal to trebble. Also there is no option to change from normal to low latency gaming mode.Battery lifeProsGreat battery life , about 45 hrs with case and on single charge buds goes for 4-5 hrs.ConsNo application support to show battery percentage for each bud as well as case . As sometimes I've noticed that the left bud's battery drains faster than the right bud .CallsNo cons till now as I've been looking for a bud that is great for calling and none of my friends complain about the voice quality even when I'm walking beside a busy road .So ENC works like a charm ️.Only thing that boult audio need to fix is they should come up with their app for changing the sound character of their earbuds as while on calls the other person's voice sounds too Bassy.Workaround -Although I'm using Poco F5 which has this feature to custom tune sound characters for wireless buds(added the screenshot as well) , So I can change from bass heavy sound character to trebble .

The premium material and all as boasted in the review videos, well, a glossy hard plastic doesn't mean it's premium.However, I would give it to the hard plastic it used, the metal hinges and leather cup quality, it sure is durable compared with the other headphones.Sound:I may say it's average or not so good for someone who wants genuine sound. I mean it's too much manipulated for my ears to listen this muffed up sound no matter what mode or settings I play it on.Just annoying it is as it makes no sense of having a 40mm driver to listen the muffed up sound. It may take a while for me to adjust to this sound. An custom app or something could have made it a better experience to get a customized sound profile.Comfort:These are heavy. I don't have any comparison criteria but just 40 mins of wearing these, made my ear heated and sweaty.But didn't caused any pain of any sort which is a good things I guess.The battery and mic quality, well I have a long way to explore that aspect.

Right earcup is having very less bass, sent it for warranty claim but they don't cover bass in the warranty.2. Ambient mode is also not working properly in right earcup and they also not solved this issue in warranty claim and rejected my claim.3. I use headphones for work and study but they did not meant for that, even you can't wear them for 1 hour they will cause a lot of pain in your head and around ear.4. ANC is pretty average for this price range, but comfort is  -10/5 Don't trust on YouTube reviews because i trusted on YouTube review and wasted my money.If you are thinking why i have not mentioned about sound quality i think sound quality doesn't matter when comfort is zero.My simple suggestion is if you are planning to buy over ear good ANC headphones save some more money and go for sony you will get good sony headphones under 10,000/-But don't go for this product.Update - They have finally replaced my product after 1.5 months of testing my patience.

The reviews are very polarising (either good or bad) and to my surprise neither were truly wrong. So i was skeptical but i found it on sale for 999 so i just bought it.. I will do a pros and cons first and a super detailed review after it (the review will be given keeping the price range of 1500-2000 in mind)Pros:- Build Quality- Sound Quality (after EQ) [Amazing Bass, crystal clear and lively vocals with ear-fatigue free & nice treble tones]- Battery Life- Dual Connectivity and stable connection- No noticeable latency in videos- Comfort- Sick RGBCons:- Mic Quality-Sound Quality (without EQ) [Amazing Bass, Bad vocals, Bad treble tones]-Low battery indications every 60 secs after 20% (didn't say 1 min as people might take it as an exaggeration)- You cant change or keep 1 colour on rgb, it changes on its own- Few Service Centres- Sometimes the headphones goes into a weird state where you have to keep the power button pressed for 10-30 seconds for it to work againMinor cons (which are completely fine for the price but are worth mentioning)-the rgb also turns on each time you power on the headphone so turning it off for more battery gets a bit annoying-The earcups dont fold (if you want to keep them on your neck then you will have to extend them , after that they wont restrict your head movement)-Each time you start/turn off the headphones or it connects/disconnects there is a voice announcement which i found to be quite annoyingDETAILED REVIEW1) Build Quality: The headband is made of made up of metal and looks very sturdy. The plastic used on the earcups is also of a good quality and i don't think it will break easily. The wire that is visible is thick and i aint worried about it. The earcups dont fold (which i knew) but it could have been a good addition.  The cushioning on the headband is minimal but soft so you wont have a problem there. The ear cushions are very soft. Dimensions of entire ear cushion 10cm x 8cm . Dimensions of the opening for our ears 5.6cm x 4cm.The buttons wobble a little bit in their place but are clicky & tactile. The box it comes in, is very Sturdy and can be used to keep the headphone.2) Looks: The headphone has a sick matte black colour which i love, the side profile looks amazing, it does look a bit bulky and weird when you look at it from the front though.3) Comfort:  I thought the hole should be as big as my ear to be comfortable which was not the case, my ear is like 6 cm and it still fits inside (with unnoticeable bending as the hole does get a bit bigger inside due to the pressure of our earlobes against it). The headphone does not feel heavy at all. The clamping force is just enough to keep the headphone from slipping, it isn't much which increases the comfort. The earcup wobbles a bit for a comfortable angle on your head. The clicks to increase or decrease the size are tight so the size wont change when you shake your head. I didn't have any discomfort wearing it for 4-5 hours straight. Although, the ears do sweat after 2-3 hours in normal temperature so you have to take a break of 2 mins (it doesnt feel warm but the sweat can speed up the wear and tear of the ear cushions. the way i do it is to just let out the air inside the headphones every once in like 30 mins for 15 secs which is much more efficient)Note: If its your first time wearing an over ear headphone then it might take a couple of days to get used to the weight and clamping force. Also, like all over ear headphones, they will be tight out of the box but they will loosen up after several hours of use (you can just put it on a pillow in between the earcushions instead if your head overnight)4) Battery Life: I think it goes upto 20-22 hours on higher volumes (can be used only till 20% is left, after that unusable due to voice alerts)5) Charging Time: Takes about 1hr 45 mins to go from 20% to 100%6) Connectivity: I tried going into another room and it worked just fine so don't worry about the range. This headphone has dual connectivity which isn't mentioned anywhere, you can connect with 2 devices and if you play something with 1 device, the other pauses and vice versa7) Latency: There is no noticeable latency in most videos or movies (there is a very slight delay which you can notice if you try noticing it hard but you wont do that while watching anything so its safe to say there is no noticeable latency, the latency can also be noticed if the person talks really fast)8) Gaming: When you do gaming via bluetooth you will notice the latency like pretty much every wireless product without a gaming mode of 80ms latency. You can make out where the sound is coming from pretty easily. You can use the aux to get 0 latency.9) Mic: The mic is straight up bad, lacks both clarity and loudness (Do note that the mic won't work with the aux cable)10) Sound Isolation: You can't really hear anything of outside if something is playing in your headphones. If the volume is loud the people around you can hear it which is a con, other headphones do a better job here11) Sound Quality (without EQ): The bass is very powerful, perfect for bass lovers but the mids and highs aren't even good12) Sound Quality (with basic EQ):The Sound is loud enough at 100% for pretty much anyone who does not have significant hearing loss. The bass can be made less powerful or even more powerful if you want to blast your skull with the bass. The mids are produced very nicely. The highs are on point (neither sharp nor dull, its sparky enough without causing ear fatigue). The clarity is also very nice, the sounds seems crystal clear and crispy The distortion is very less.(Note: My Basic EQ is just take the little dots in the right half and increase all of them to some extent, keep the leftmost dot where it was and try to make a straight line between the leftmost and middle dots with the other dots left in the left half). One thing to note is that, you will find that the headphone skipped a word, its random and not that often but its worth mentioning13) Sound quality via aux: The same things apply here but the max volume is 90% of what it was via bluetooth and the clarity gets a boost if you play FLAC format music1 Year Edit for Durability: Everything still stands true, the earcup vinyl (i think that is the material) startedcoming off suddenly after 10 months i think and now its gone but it doesnt make a difference to sound or comfort. It randomly stopped working, i think the power button disconnected so i sent them via courier to the service centre (in warranty) and they sent it back in a week i think. I dropped them twice from 3 feet and it stayed fine, but someone sat on my headphones and one side got de-attached from the headband held on just by wire, it then dropped twice after that and that one side stopped working. I tried contacting service centres about how much the repair will cost so that i dont end up spending 400 or something to get this headphone repaired when i bought it for 999 but they didnt respond so i can spend either 100 to get this to the service centre by courier (most companies have a pick up service like soundcore) or go 20km away to get it repaired myself (which is hard during covid). Do Check if there are service centres around you before you get a zeb product.\nRead more", '\nIt\'s been a year since I ordered this, headphones were pretty good lasted for a year n around tho I faced few glitches with Bluetooth connectivity near the last months of use.Mic wasn\'t the best "kamchalau"RGB lights look good, they r quite bulky and the cup size might look weirdSound quality was good as per the price, never hurted my braincells or ears\nRead more', '\nI am Using this product since two weeks for 3-4 hours daily and came up with this conclusion.Pros:1.

And for audio volume level, It gives hearable sound in just 18% of computer audio and when i increase audio upto 100 i can hear even the base from 40cm far from the headphones.As for comfort The cushions are really good, i was able to keep it on ears for 3hrs but not more than that cause it mae my head feel dizzy cause of hearing all my favourate melodies, old school, hip hop, rap and metal songs all at once LOL, But like other headphones i bought this one is stiff and feels like it will break if pressurised to stretch .As for looks I love the RGB and the grill metal look it gives is DOPE along with plastic matte cover. It is quiet big like having two black and glowing eggs attached to ears but its worth cause the big egg things has lot of BASS inside LOL.The battery life is incredible, I have been using it since yesterday and it still have 50% battery left.ONLY PROBLEM is that I found the audio has sharp voice somewhat maximised to keep up with that heavy bass, like when you hear a song you will hear the vocals in sharp voice which is not actually pleasant. I counter this problem by using an equilizer in phone and laptop by decreasing the 14 KHz to some level and increasing 910 Hz to some level. And it only happens in bluetooth mode, The aux is perfect though.Apart from all this I love my new headphone, Zebronics done a fabulous job by making it and selling it in such an affordable price.\nRead more', "\nSound is good for the price, bass is adequate and volume is high enough but overall looking at the sound quality, it feels crappy and very low quality.

I got this for around 4999 INR, and for the price it fits my use case perfectly.Pretty comfortable on the head, but I\'ve not used super high-end headphones either but this can easily remain on your head without any discomfort for 1-2 hours at a stretch. Although because of the material used on the earcups, you might feel a bit sweaty and hot around your ears if you\'re in a hot environment (happened to me a couple of times, but it\'s not too much of an issue).The sound quality is fine. Again, I\'m not going to pretend to be an audiophile, but it does seem to be tuned for the Bass-ier sounds than an even sound. Music is great, but doesn\'t do voices as well but it\'s definitely above average and great for the price.The connectivity is great. I love dual-pairing and the fast-pair functionality. Although I do have some issues with how unpredictably it falls asleep when not in use - sometimes even when it\'s not in use, it\'ll stay on for the whole night, and sometimes it\'ll fall asleep when not in use for 10-15 mins. But it might be something with the way I\'m using it. I have it paired to 2 devices all the time.The battery life is great for me, use it for 4-5 hours in a day, and lasts about a week. Charges pretty fast too. Top up for 10 mins will get an hour or two of listening. (but read the noise cancellation section also)The build quality is average or leaves a little to be desired. It feels very cheap, but more importantly, the first thought I had when I picked it up was that "It feels really fragile" and that it will break if I so much as look at it the wrong way. Sometimes, you hear the plastic creaking when you put it on or take it off (Yikes)The noise cancellation is just bad. It makes a marginal difference to the listening experience, and only blocks out really low sounds (the fan, AC and other low humming sounds) but does not do anything to anything more than that, if it\'s raining you\'ll very likely be able to hear the rain clearly.You\'ll still be able to hear people perfectly, sometimes even clearer than without the NC one as it blocks out other ambient noises lmao. and it seems to have this \'directional\' problem where it\'s great it cancelling sounds coming from infront of you, but not so much for things coming from the sides and behind.But don\'t get this for the NC, just pretend it\'s not there. Also because the NC cuts down the battery life to almost half the normal use with a minimal upgrade to listening experience.Although they advertise it as foldable and it can indeed be folded into a smaller size. It feels even more fragile in the folded position and the folded position decreased the total area used by around 30-40% only. Not worth folding.The last thing I hate is the wired connection. For some weird reason, it\'s not a 3.5mm to 3.5mm aux jack like you would normally see. It\'s a weird 2.5mm to 3.5mm connector. So if you want to connect it like that, make sure you carry around the bundled cable they give.\nRead more', '\nThis is my review of JBL Tune 710BT after one year of purchase.This was my first headphone purchase. I have only used earphones before. I\'m writing this because I\'m unsure what to expect for this price. I bought them for Rs.4000. In this one year, I can say that I have used these headphones a lot and have a few points to say about it.Pros -1. Battery life - They mention it\'s 50 hrs and it is. I have completed the series "Peaky Blinders" on a single charge with 20% battery remaining. That\'s some next-level battery life, considering the driver\'s size.2. Sound quality - The sound quality (excluding the bass) is pretty good, what some would say is a classic JBL signature.3. Comfort - It is very comfortable. As I said, I come from an earphone background, so it took a while to get used to it.4. Dual-device connectivity - This feature is a blessing and works effortlessly. But it only works effortlessly on Windows. I have an Android (Samsung) phone and tried connecting it with Windows(10/11) and Linux (Debian) systems as well. I faced some hiccups on the Linux side, but that can be due to incompatible audio drivers.5. Charging Speed - It takes more than an hour to charge from 0 to 100. But a quick 10-minute charge can last for hours.Cons -1. Sound quality (Bass) - It\'s too low. You can feel it only at higher volumes (>85%).2. Built quality - I don\'t know if I can expect a well-built headphone at Rs.4000. It is comfortable, but after a few hours of continuous usage, my ear gets sweaty, and I have to remove them for a few minutes. And all of this from staying indoors. DO NOT use this outdoors for jogging or running or at the gym. I tried my best to keep them away from sweat or wet hair, but as you can see from the photos, the leather (or whatever that material is) starts to deteriorate. The stitching of the right ear cup suddenly gave up one day. I tried to fix it using fevicol (glue), and you can see how they look from the photos.3. Over-the-ear - It is not over the ear. I have tried a few over-the-ear headphones, and this is not it. I think I have a decent-sized ear, and the rims of my ear touch and sometimes get folded by the inner cushion of the ear cups of this headphone. These are a little bit smaller to be called over-the-ear headphones.Conclusions -1. Don\'t buy this if you sweat a lot or plan to take this outdoors.2. Don\'t expect bass from it. My Rs.500 earphone (Realme Buds 2) has more bass than this.3. Other than bass, the sound is good.4. They are not fully Over-the-ear. So, some people might feel uncomfortable.5. A decent pair of headphones, but I expected a better-built quality for Rs.4000.\nRead more', "\nLet me rate this product first on different parameters.• Sound Quality - 4/5• Comfort - 5/5 (This is subjective as everybody has different ear and head sizes. It fits perfectly one me like an over the ear headphone.)• Bass - 3/5• Bluetooth connectivity - 5/5• Noice Cancellation - 2/5• Treble - Low and mid trebles were flat but highs were good.If you are addicted to bass then you will be more or less disappointed (Now, this doesn't mean that they don't have any bass). The USP of this headphone is- balance. It balances everything out.Overall I am impressed with this Tune 710BT. A few days ago I ordered Tune 510BT, and everything was according to my liking, but the problem was that those were 'on ear' headphone, and hence they were painful. So, I ordered these 'over the ear' ones and I am thoroughly impressed.Although, bass and low trebles could have been better and fair price should have been under 3k rather than 4k.We have got to understand that these are an entry level/cheap headsets for a brand like JBL.\nRead more", '\nO fone é realmente muito bom e, apesar de não ter cancelamento ativo de ruído, a construção dele faz com que quando você o coloque ele abafe consideravelmente barulhos externos e isso foi uma surpresa bastante positiva, pois fones com cancelamento ativo de ruído são bem mais caros e esse, só com a espuma na orelha e o ajuste dele, supre um pouquinho disso. Por conta dessa característica, algumas pessoas podem achar que ele aperta muito. Bom, ele aperta, mas na minha opinião, apenas um pouco, não é muito a ponto de ser desconfortável a longo prazo, é um aperto "padrão" para esses fones sem fio.O som dele é incrível, como já era de se esperar da JBL. Tem um volume ótimo, sem precisar estar sempre no máximo e tem graves e agudos incríveis. E a bateria? DURA MUITOOOO! Eu uso ele todo dia, num uso médio e ele dura mais de 4 dias a bateria fácil e para carregar, não cheguei a contar quanto tempo, mas também carrega super rápido (como eu disse, não cheguei a contar mas pela minha baixíssima percepção de tempo, parece ter sido uns 10 min kkkkkkkkkk). A construção física do fone também parece ótima, não tem nada "balançando", solto, ou algo do tipo. Tudo parece estar onde deveria estar.Entretanto, algumas considerações que pode desagradar alguns mas para mim, até agora, que já tô usando a mais de um mês, está tudo ok, tudo normal: A capinha que reveste a espuma que vai na orelha parece ser um "saquinho plástico bem vagabundo", como se fosse rasgar logo logo mas até agora está tudo certo, nada de ruim aconteceu. O cabo para carregamento (USB tipo C) entra só até a metade nele e parece que esse é o normal, pois não entra mais do que isso e carrega normalmente, mas com certeza é estranho (até pq a gente fica com vontade de forçar para entrar um pouco mais). Se você usar ele ligado, mas a um certo tempo sem estar tocando nada (+10 min), ele começa a dar um leve zumbidinho, bem bem baixinho no lado direito. Não sei se é só o meu, mas acontece isso.Por último, eu comprei ele para ser meu fone para tudo, inclusive para eu usar nas aulas online do Google Meet, falando e ouvindo, entretanto, flopou totalmente pq a internet fica muito ruim quando usamos ele no Meet, eu não sei por quê, mas é inviável assistir aula por ele pq fica direto caindo e não dá nem pra abrir outras páginas no computador, mas assim que você o desliga, tudo volta magicamente a funcionar bem. É estranho pois uso ele na TV em plataformas de streaming de filmes, uso ele no celular para tudo, uso ele no notebook para YouTube enquanto faço milhares de outras coisas no computador e não tem nenhum problema, mas se eu abrir o Google Meet o uso da internet no Notebook fica imprestável se estiver usando esse fone.\nRead more', '\nBom, como não vi ninguém aqui relatar o que eu vivi com esse produto, me sinto na obrigação de comunicar aquelas variáveis  sobre o produto que você só descobre com o tempo e pela repetição dos mesmos impasses e armadilhas nas três ocasiões em que comprei. Isso já virou uma saga. Essa foi a terceira vez que eu comprei um JBL sem fio. Os dois primeiros ainda eram o de 500, e há seis meses atrás comprei esse do 510. Pois bem, venho aqui seis meses depois relatar o que só os usuários intensivos descobrem: que esta porcaria tem uma obsolescência programada monstruosa. A razão pela qual eu já comprei TRÊS VEZES fones da JBL ao longo dos últimos três anos é que, em todos esses casos, passados alguns meses, a bateria se suicida, ou então o fone não liga, ou qualquer erro aleatório começa a dinamitar a possibilidade de utilizá-lo. Ou seja, tudo é lindo e maravilhoso, desde que você use pouco, porque a vida útil dele é ridiculamente curta.Não me levem a mal, se eu comprei três vezes é porque todo o resto é fantástico: o som grave é quase imperial, a bateria, quando ainda funciona, é colossal nesse 510 e muito acima da concorrência.Entretanto, é isso que eu preciso vir falar aqui: toda essa lua de mel funciona para quem usa pouco, para quem usa de forma intensiva, você esbarra claramente no limite da obsolescência programada do produto: míseros meses são o suficiente pro aparelho se suicidar, não querer ligar, a bateria pular de 50% pra 0% sem razão alguma, etc. Isso não deveria acontecer, haja vista que até celular dura muito mais do que isso sem ficar inutilizável. O que adianta  JBL fazer um fone fantástico se esse "fantástico" dura 5 meses? Este último foi a gota d\'água, foi a compra foi feita no dia 28 de janeiro de 2022 e esta desgraça já está ruim agora, no início de agosto. Até os produtos anteriores da marca tinham durado mais que isso. Enfim, essa é a situação dialética que os usuários tem de ser informados: sim, ele é ótimo, colossal, mas essa lua de mel tem uma vida útil muito reduzida. Antes eu pensava que era problema da unidade que eu comprei, algo de exceção, mas passadas três vezes que comprei o produto e em todas elas acontece isso, já vemos um padrão.\nRead more', '\nPuedo realizar una comparación de este modelo  JBL T760BTNC con\xa0\nSony WH-XB910N EXTRA BASS\n\xa0que también los tengo y pertenecen ambos a la misma gama de sonido. En general sin entrar en muchas especificaciones me han parecido unos buenos auriculares que al precio que están aquí en Amazon me parecen correctos y son una buena oferta en mi opinión no llegando a los 90 euros actualmente.Valorando la calidad que tiene la presentación y los propios auriculares en si, me parecen que llegan con una buena presentación y la calidad en general de los auriculares son de este tipo de gama, pesan muy poco, son muy cómodos y te atrapa toda la oreja por lo que la inmersión en el sonido está muy bien.La calidad que tiene las almohadillas me parecen mejores que los Sony de los que hablo, ya que estos, se me han deteriorado muy rápidamente, aunque existen recambios y se pueden cambiar fácilmente, algo que en los JBL desconozco por el momento si es posible.SONIDO.En cuanto al sonido en si, es cierto que tienen sonidos distintos, los JBL no tienen unos graves muy pronunciados, algo que se puede mejorar con un ecualizado por software pero el equilibrio que tiene me parece acertado para personas que no quieran tener siempre un zumbido en la cabeza con los graves, es decir equilibrio entre medios y agudos y bajos no muy altos, como he dicho se pueden mejorar con un software de ecualización. Aquí, personalmente, los Sony tienen más cuerpo en general, pensado quizás para una música que tenga unos bajos muy pronunciados, hip hop, pop, etc, sin embargo con música como metal personalmente los tengo que bajar por lo que creo que tienen un punto superior a estos JBL.CANCELACIÓN DE RUIDO.Ambos tienen un muy buen sistema de cancelación de sonido activa, excelentes aunque los JBL necesitan un punto más alto de volumen para sentirte totalmente aislado y creo que en este caso el sistema de Sony los supera, no por mucho, pero si en reducción.En ambos casos no escucho ruidos molestos ni sonidos demasiados agudos como me ocurre con otros Jabra que tengo, que nos lo comparo porque pertenecen a otra gama más elevada. En definitiva buena cancelación de sonido.SOFTWAREAquí es un punto que no entiendo, los JBL TUNE760NC no son compatibles con la aplicación JBL Headphones, no podemos por lo tanto ecualizarlos ni configurarlos a nuestro gusto, sin embargo los Sony WH-XB910N, si. No suele ser importante para personas que simplemente quieran unos auriculares para escuchar música, hablar por teléfono etc, pero para mi es un punto importante siendo de esta gama de auriculares.COMODIDAD.Son realmente cómodos, no pesan en absoluto y las almohadillas son blandas y por ahora no se deforman ni se están deteriorando. En la diadema superior no tiene ningún tipo de apoyo o aporte para poder amortiguar la presión, pero en general son muy cómodos.CONCLUSIÓN.Me han parecido unos buenos auriculares, dentro de la gama que estamos hablando lo esperado en sonido, quizás si buscas unos bajos potentes estos no sean los tuyos, si busca algo equilibrado puede ser una buena opción a tener en cuenta.Que no tenga soporte por aplicación es algo que no termina de gustarme personalmente, pero en general considero que al precio que los he comprado a la fecha de escribir esta opinión están bastante bien para usuario no muy exigentes los considero unos buenos auriculares. Para más exigentes hay que irse a otras gamas más elevadas.Espero que esta opinión te haya servido de ayuda,\nRead more', '\nO produto chegou antes do esperado, parabéns Total Express e Amazon!

Dá para ouvir e sair andando pela casa sem estar perto do celular, ah isola o som ambiente até que bem, minha mãe gritou e eu nem ouvi! :) Quando liguei tive dificuldade para conectar com mais de um aparelho (um de cada vez, é claro), primeiro liguei conectei com o iPad e funcionou, aí desconectei e tentei conectar com o celular Samsung e não reconhecia, aí tentei com o notebook Sony Vaio e também não ia. Fiquei com raiva e achava que era defeito, cheguei até abrir uma reclamação e iria devolver…. Imagina ;( … Tentei baixar App da JbL e ainda fui no site, nada, procurei no manual e nada! Até que tentei no Google! Google salva vidas! Achei um vídeo que falava que ia resolver o problema de forma simples, e assim o fez! Era apenas um probleminha de configuração, onde vc tem que restaurar a configuração para a de fábrica apertando (segurar o botão durante 30 segundos, mais ou menos) os botões + e - ao mesmo tempo até que a luz branca dele mude para cor azul e comece a piscar, pronto feito isso ele conectou em tudo! A única coisa chata é que tenho que repetir esse processo toda vez que vou mudar de aparelho conectado!

Qualidade de som e microfone boas para uso cotidiano, o isolamento não é total, mas pra mim não é um problema.O material é excelente, super articulado e o tecido que recobre as almofadas é tipo um courino, fácil de limpar e após meses utilizando continua como se fosse novo. Uma simples limpeza com pano úmido e detergente neutro é o suficiente.Sofro com fones que apertam a cabeça, e este modelo não me causa dor. Consigo utilizar por horas a fio sem nenhum desconforto.A duração da bateria é absurdamente boa. Não é possível utilizar o fone enquanto carrega, mas tem a opção de utilizar um plugue de entrada 3mm que acompanha o fone. A recarga é super rápida.A conexão com outros aparelhos é simples, e consigo conectar a mais de um aparelho ao mesmo tempo. Utilizo com celular e notebook e eles alternam de forma automática à medida que um e outro emitem sons.Por último faço uma comparação com o fone modelo 510BT (também da JBL): este modelo 710BT é muito superior. O outro já está com cara de velho, qualidade de som inferior e aperta muito a cabeça e o tecido que recobre o fone é de qualidade inferior e difícil de limpar.Recomendo demais este modelo, compraria novamente de olhos fechados.\nRead more']}{'title': '        (Refurbished) JBL Tune 760NC, Over Ear Active Noise Cancellation Bluetooth Headphones with Mic, up to 50 Hours Playtime, JBL Pure Bass, Google Fast Pair, Dual Pairing, AUX (Black)       ', 'reviews': ['\nBulid quality is good but sound not satisfied\nRead more', '\nsound quality is not that good as expected from a brand like JBL .

The headphones were awesome, seemed like brand new in the beginning. For the first two months worked very well but yea i couldn't charge it beyond 60% but it worked for abt 50 hours so i thought it was a software bug. Then the battery would drop like crazy when i used the noise cancelling feature which i didn't mind since i rarely used it. At about 5 months mark it randomly stopped working, like it used to switch off automatically when turned on. Took it to a jbl service center but they said they wont work with renewed/refurbished products. Came back to amazon customer service and after submitting several proofs they finally agreed for a replacement/refund. Seriously would have been screwed if it malfunctioned after the 6 month mark when seller warrenty becomes voidHowever the product is insanely good so will recommend anyone to buy the original one rather than going for the renewed ones. I am skeptical of service center folks coz in my experince if a product fails even in its warranty period service center ppl go with juggad rather than fully fixing it but jbl has good service centers.

Keep in mind that the music sounds different with noise cancelling on and if you listen to music at volume greater than 80% then it switches off noise cancelling. More or less noise cancelling won't make a difference if you are at home and there are people chatting in the living room....I use the headphones for ~10 to 12 hours a day and it reaches 50% after a day's useage with noise cancelling on for half the time.

On the one hand, they excel in terms of features and audio quality, but on the other, their long-term durability is a significant concern when it comes to the wired version.First, let's discuss the positive aspects. The Samsung earphones come packed with features that enhance the listening experience. The sound quality is impressive, delivering crisp and clear audio across a wide range of frequencies. They also offer great noise isolation, which is perfect for shutting out the outside world and immersing yourself in your music or podcasts.The earphones are comfortable to wear for extended periods, and they fit securely in your ears, which is a big plus for active individuals or commuters. The in-line microphone and remote control make it easy to manage calls and playback without reaching for your phone, adding convenience to your daily routine.However, the Achilles' heel of these earphones is their durability, especially when it comes to the wired version. Over time, I found that the wires tend to fray and weaken, leading to audio issues and sometimes complete loss of functionality. It's disappointing to see such a great product compromised by the relatively short lifespan of the wires.If you're considering purchasing these Samsung earphones, I'd strongly recommend the wireless version for better durability. While they come at a higher price point, they eliminate the wire-related durability concerns and provide a more extended period of reliable usage.In conclusion, the Samsung earphones offer excellent audio quality and a range of features that enhance the listening experience. However, if you opt for the wired version, be prepared for potential durability issues with the wires over time. For a more lasting and hassle-free experience, the wireless option may be the way to go.\nRead more", '\nVery good product in this price range, good sound, fit for ear comfort.

The built quality is amazing, all around it's plastic with foam on the headband but it's very sturdy, the headband is not too loose, slightly tight but it does loosen up a bit eventually2. Comfort - The ear foams are ok/meh but do feel a little uncomfortable after like 2 or 3 hrs, and not much ventilation so It might a get a little hot during the summers3. Mic - The mic is also pretty good, it does a poor job filtering surrounding noise, you wouldn't be able to hear the noise but it lowers your sound4. Sound Quality - I'm not an audiphile but the sound is also good, not too high of a bass but it gets pretty loud without bleeding5. Latency - There isn't much latency or any latency at all that I noticed while daily use, ie on YouTube, media play etc, but there is a significant lag when gaming SO DON'T BUY THIS FOR GAMING6. Connectivity- Connectivity is also ok but not too great, the connection breaks and after like 5,6 seconds it reconnects automatically, it doesn't happen too often but it does happen usually after long hours of usage7. Battery Life - battery Life is pretty good, I can go 3 days without charging with pretty heavy usage, the battery indication (in the app) is a little off though,meaning it might show 100% within 15-20 mins of charging but the battery drains quickly, you gotta let it charge for an additional 20/30 mins after hitting 100% for the battery to actually be full8. Range- The range is not bad, nothing crazy, around 5 to 6 meters9.

The product is a bit tricky to setup with the app and you have to follow YouTube videos to get it setup. I wish Xiaomi provides video tutorial links in their user manuals. They don\'t mention it but we need Bluetooth and WiFi connection to be setup, for the app and robot  to work together. This tip is missing in user manual.2. WiFi connectivity does get lost sometimes but that is because my router is far from certain places in my house. That time the robot needs to be brought back to the WiFi range. 5GHz connection does not work with this model.3. The robot takes anywhere between 40-60 minutes to completely vaccum my 800 sq. ft house. Battery life is really good in the new model. 50% or more is still left after one complete sweep or mop cycle of my house. Charging is also not bad. It took 1.5 hrs for it to charge full 100% the first time.4. Couple of times it got confused in a specific area in my house and I had to reset the entire house map for it to work properly again. Once the map was created and the device has sweeped and mopped that area for a couple of times, it would not repeat this behavior.5. Dusting is of A1 quality. Each time the amount of dust collected is staggering. We never knew we had so much dust in our house!6. Mopping is average. I would call it "light wiping" and not mopping. Hard stains or sticky stains or dry stains are not affected by the mopping. Only light dust or weak stickiness gets wiped out. Adding a bit of floor cleaning liquid or Vim liquid in the water helps.7. Vacuum + Mop mixed mode is limited in its effectiveness. In this mode, mopping sometimes wets the floor and causes dry dust to stick to the floor which the vaccum is not able to pick up.I recommend vacuum and mop as two separate cycles.8. Keeping mop extension attached to the robot all the time causes mopping cloth to accumulate dirt, and when it gets dragged along the floor it causes wet dirty mop to be wiped around the house. This is not ideal. So it\'s important to remove that extension from the vacuum bot when you are only vacuuming and not mopping.9. The mop works horribly on door mats (main door or bathroom mats). It gets very dirty when it moves over mats and then that wet dirt spreads all over the place. So please remove all the mats, esp. during mopping session.10. Noise levels are pretty low in medium mode. Sometimes we don\'t even know where it has gone, it gets so quiet.Pros.* Battery life* Suction power* Noise levels* VacuumingCons* Mopping is average. It\'s at best can be called as light wiping.* Setup is bit tricky, user manual is insufficient. Xiaomi does not contact or send any demo person at home. You have to figure it out using YouTube videos. I can see old people or non tech savvy people will highly struggle with this thing.* Once the device is confused it doesn\'t correct itself automatically. It needs a map reset.* Door mats make the mop even dirtier so please remove them or other items on the floor before mopping.Such tips nobody gives you and you have to learn them on your own.But I still recommend this device as it is very effective in sweeping the dust in the house clean.\nRead more', "\nThis is going to be detailed review.I was using first version of MI Robo Mop in the past and this is my upgrade from Old version to new version. There is definitely lot of improvement from previous version to latest version and it is for better.Suction capacity is increased, it means that there is better dust cleaning capacity.LDS Navigation is increased, it means that there is less travel within the house and there by effeciency increased.Increased dust tank capacity - I'm cleaning tank less often then previous version. Previous one we have to clean the tank every 2-3 days, latest one I'm cleaning it for 3-4 days.One more major improvement I observed in the app settings for the latest version. There are lot of customizable options provided which can be setup as per our needs. Attaching screenshots.In latest version there is no need to start entire home cleaning for creating map. There is option to create map without cleaning and mop will scan the rooms and creates maps for you, which I think is one of the major change and I liked it very much.My final verdict is if you are looking for budget Robo Vaccum then Mop 2 pro is best option and if you are using previous version upgrade to this version and you find it better in lot many ways.I got it for ₹23,999 which is super deal price during Amazon great Indian festival.\nRead more", '\nI purchased the device a month ago, and I must say, it has significantly lightened the cleaning workload for my mother in our 1300 sq ft house. This device is incredibly easy to program and use, making it a convenient addition to our household chores. While it has its limitations, overall, it has proven to be a good buy.One of the standout features of this vacuum robot is its user-friendly interface. Programming it is a breeze, allowing us to effortlessly schedule cleaning sessions according to our needs. Its performance has been commendable, efficiently navigating through our home and leaving no corner untouched. The device lives up to its promises and delivers the expected results. At times, it\'s confused. But again, it\'s easy to bring it back to its senses.Maintaining the vacuum robot is also hassle-free, as it is easy to clean. This saves us valuable time and ensures that the device remains in optimal working condition. The customer service during the installation process was decent, providing a satisfactory and convenient experience.However, the mopping feature of the robot falls short of expectations. While it can effectively be used once a week, the frequent refilling required to cover our entire house is inconvenient. It demands at least three refills, which can become tiresome over time. Although it serves its purpose, there is room for improvement in this aspect.Additionally, the battery life of the vacuum robot could have been better. While it is sufficient to clean the house twice on a single charge, an extended battery life would have been appreciated. However, it is worth noting that the suction power of the device is exceptional. I have never seen the floors so clean in ages, and it truly justifies the purchase.On the downside, despite offering four different modes, including a "silent" option, I was disappointed to find that it did not live up to its name. The noise level remained nearly identical to the "Standard" mode, which was unexpected. It would have been ideal if the "silent" mode truly provided a quieter operation, allowing the device to clean the house without disturbing the peace. Unfortunately, it fell short in this aspect.Nevertheless, considering the impressive suction power and the overall effectiveness in cleaning, I still believe that this vacuum robot is worth the purchase. It efficiently reduces the workload, leaves the floors spotless, and offers convenient programming and scheduling options. Despite the minor flaws, the benefits outweigh the drawbacks, making it a worthy investment for a cleaner home.Furthermore, it is worth mentioning that my mother, who is over 60 years old, has been able to handle and use the vacuum robot without any issues. Its user-friendly design caters to different age groups and abilities, making it accessible for individuals like her.In conclusion, this vacuum robot has been a valuable addition to our household, significantly reducing the cleaning workload and providing convenience. However, the limitations of the mopping feature and the questionable value for money prevent me from giving it a full endorsement.\nRead more', '\nEasy to use can be controlled easily by app and adding virtual wall is useful..Cleaning is good .One star less as dor some small items stick while vacuuming so we have to work around before it takes round\nRead more']}{'title': '        AGARO Regal 800 Watts Handheld Vacuum Cleaner,For Home Use,Dry Vacuuming,6.5 Kpa Suction Power,Lightweight,Lightweight&Durable Body,Small/Mini Size ( Black),0.8 Liter,Cloth       ', 'reviews': ["\nI've been using this for a few months now.

Since I had tried to use it, I didn't think it would qualify for a return.  I left a review about the overheating, and was really (pleasantly) surprised that the seller reached out to me about the problems on their own initiative.  They were really polite, asked a few questions about the problems I was having, and then offered to replace or refund my purchase.  They processed the refund in under an hour.  I wanted to come back and update the review to reflect the customer service in my rating- the device has a lot of positive reviews, so I assume mine was just a fluke, and for the price, it's a really nice kit with more than the usual standard accessories (the booklet especially was nice bc I had no idea what each head was technically supposed to do).Had I not bought another grinder before I talked to them, I would have taken the exchange (they didn't even ask me to send the original one back), just bc the rest of the reviews were overwhelmingly positive.  A company that stands behind their product says a lot more about their business ethos than a single dud product. At no point did they ask me to change my review; the replacement/refund offer was genuinely them just standing behind their product and customers, which is why I did want to update it.  It's definitely one of the nicer kits at this price point, and I would definitely give it another shot if I need to replace the one I bought after theirs in the future.Original review:It came with a lot of accoutrements - two different sets of grinding heads (each in their own case), a large baggie of sanding bands (which are only used for one grinder head, so they will definitely last you awhile), the device itself, and a booklet that explains what each grinder head is used for, with trouble shooting tips and a six month warranty if you complete the registration process (it's explained in the last section of the booklet).  The device also comes with a cable and built in adapter; the cord is fairly long but you do need to keep it plugged in while using.Unfortunately, my device kept heating up within 30 seconds of turning it on.  It's all metal, so it got too hot to even hold.  The cord has an on/off switch, and a forward/reverse switch. It plugs into the bottom of your device like a head jack, and the adapter goes into an electrical outlet.  The drill bits/grinder heads basically attach by pushing them in, then twisting a tiny bit at the end. I had some issues with the device turning on and off- some of the drill bits/grinder heads didn't seem to connect, while others were a bit less twitchy.  Between that and the overheating, I couldn't really use it.The booklet specs say that the input voltage range is 100-240 V (50/60Hz), and the output is DC 12V 1A.  Our outlets are only 120 volts (which is the norm for regular household outlets, stateside, while larger utilities like washers and dryers, refrigerators, etc are higher).  I tried it on several different outlets, but the device overheats on all of them.  The device should not be overheating since I am well below the voltage limit. In other words, this was definitely caused by the internal wiring of the device itself.\nRead more", '\nGood value if you replacements included quality held up well only other way of where to order more chips to replace the files worn out.\nRead more', '\nOverall I like the device and think it works well.

I have these earphones from 4 months and these haven't tangled since. Also the rubber coating and the inside braided wires gives a nice  looking effect.But 1 thing I have seen is the middle piece which have a mic and buttons is 180 degree reversed. so, many times it's difficult to pick the right or left earphone without seeing. But it is mentioned on the earphones so that becomes easy.Now about the main part the internalsThe sound quality is so so nice. As you can see in my title. Solid 8/10. You can listen any music like lofi or peacefull type and when it's time for a party you can listen rock, bass boosted songs with such a adorable quality its the true definition for true sound and at cheap prices.Bass quality is also good.perfect for the ears. And if u want high bass, I tried it with max bass it can produce and that's awesome. But don't listen high bass for long. Those can hurt ur ears really bad.But noice cancellation is 4/10.seems like there is no noice cancellation. Maybe its mentioned for the mic not for the earpiece.Obviously there are very high quality products then this product but those will alteast cost 2000. But I will choose this product instead of a 1500 one or less than 1500 because this cost less than 500 or sometimes less than 400(depends on sale) but quality and services of these products are not less than of a 2000 rs earphone.In past, 1 of my earphone died but the coustmer care is so generous, there services are so cool and quick. So those got replaced within 3 days. (it's 3 days because I forgot the eslip, if you mail them with everting ready it won't take more than 2 working days)It's an honest review by me and I will definitely suggest you to but these. ️Edited:-Their services are slower now. Don't know why and it takes around 1. 5week to 2 weeks to get the refund. If something happens to ur earphones.Also its been like 1 year as of 1-9-21And I saw some trend with it.

The delivery was perfect.Initial Disappointment - After opening the package, I realized the Blue color piece I ordered was different from what is shown in pictures here. Depending on the angle it can appear dark metallic greyish, greenish, bluish or black (handles from where the wires are coming out). But fine I can live with it.Slow Charging - It was 70% charged when I got it but took nearly 2.5 hrs to reach 100% charge.Sound quality, bass, noise cancellation is very good and battery life was awesome.The microphone is also good (but read on). Quite comfortable for ears, no pain even after continuous 4-5 hrs usage.Fast pairing with mobile and laptop and a solid stable connection with nearly no playback delays. So far so good.Build Quality - Here is where the disappointment starts. Wires used are thin and appears fragile, gives you a feeling that a slight pull/strech can snap the wire especially at the earphone end (though it's a neckband but it still has wires which can get pulled if you are not careful).Then I noticed small cracks near white circular lines on the see in the images attached.Bluetooth Issues - Earlier I said excellent Bluetooth connectivity and no noticeable delays, well the truth is that it is applicable only up to range of 4.5-5.0 meter from your playback device. Go beyond that, there is a huge delay, the voice cracks as if you are playing a badly scratched CD/DVD, any many times total disconnection from your playback device, which obviously is irritating and frustrating.I am happy that I got the refund but there was a potential loss of ₹75/- as I didn't get another chance to use that coupon nor a new coupon of the same value was provided.A general tip applicable to any USB powered device (from my own experience over the years)-When you insert the provided charging cable in the charging port on the device, then if you can see more than 1mm of metal part of the charging cable, then it is guaranteed that either the charging cable or the charging port or both, used are of cheap quality. Although this doesn't necessarily mean your device will stop functioning or get damaged in a short time. It means that the probability of your device getting failed or damaged is high since the parts used are of substandard quality !So overall it depends on the actual item you received.

Two from amazon and one from offline market.PROS1. Sound Quality: The sound quality is great for this budget. You will enjoy watching movies and listening to songs on these. The trebble is good so you will hear the dialogs very clearly. Base is decent at this price point but don’t expect them to be too good on the base as these are budget TWS but again the sound is great for what you are paying for.2. Battery Backup: For this budget the battery backup on these tiny things is outstanding. You can easily watch a full 3.5 to 4 hour movie without worrying that the battery will die. Infact, I have even used these straight for more than 4 hours and its battery never gave up on me. Adding to that, the case itself has its own battery so the buds will charge as soon as you put them back in the case so basically the battery lasts for more than a week if you use them daily on regular basis for 3-4 hours daily.3. Durability: After using them for about 8 months I can assure you that these will not fail on you and are very durable. All three of them which I bought are working fine without any issues. I also suggested them to some of my friends and collegues and their TWS are also working fine till date.4. Touch Sensors: You get touch sensors on each of the buds which you can use to play, pause, skip tracks, next and previous songs in the list, picking up calls etc.5. Latency: On normal mode I didn’t find them lagging behind but if you want to use them for gaming with super low latency then it comes with something called ‘BEAST MODE’ which further improves latency but at the cost of faster battery drain. So you can definitely use them for gaming. To switch to ‘Beast Mode’ just tap thrice on the touch sensors on any of the buds.6. Size: These are tiny. You can see the photo where I have put them besides a AA battery to have an idea of their size. So you can put these in your pocket without making them bulky. These are super portable.7. USB C Charging: These have a USB C port for charging so you can charge these easily with your phone charger. You can also find a USB A to C charging cable inside the box.8. Connectivity: Pairing these with your phone is super simple and quick. The phone remembers the connection so when you turn your Bluetooth on next time it will connect automatically to these. Moreover, you can use only one bud at a time and keep the other one in the case and later one if you do decide to use both then you can simple take out the other one from the case and it will connect automatically with the one already connected to your phone.9. Different size ear plugs: These also comes with different size ear plugs so you can pick one that fits your ears for better comfort.10. Fast charging: Once you put the earbuds inside the case they charge real fast so even if they run out of battery (which they don’t, trust me) you can charge them up in just 5 minutes for almost an hour of playback.11. Battery level LEDs: The case have four LEDs on the front that shows you the battery level and charging status. You can also see the battery percentage of the buds on the phone when they are connected to it.CONS:1. Build: Though the build is very good, out of three I bought two of them came with a loose cap that was a little wobbly. Though the wobble was very minimum but still I felt that the build quality is not consistent.2. Less Base: The base not these TWS is not that great but as I said these are budget TWS that comes with decent base for the price.3. Range: The range is surely not their strength. You will loose connection if you go far from your source OR will experience sound drop if anything like wall etc. comes between these TWS and the source. But if you are sitting close to the source with clear line of sight in 3-5 m radius then you will have best connection without any signal drops. Additionally I also experienced signal drops when they have almost 20 to 30% battery left so make sure you keep the buds and case charged above these levels.4. Not for workouts: These will slip from your ears if you use them for intense workouts or jogging as they don’t have the ear hooks.5. Battery percentage: You cannot see the exact battery percentage for the case as it does not have a display.6. USB C Cable: The supplied USB C cable is very short as you can see in the pictures. But since everyone will most likely charge them using their phone charges so it’s not a big deal.7. Microphone: Each of the earbuds have a microphone built in for calling but when I tried these over a call, I got a feedback from my friend that he was not hearing my voice very well when compared to my phone’s inbuilt microphone. So I don’t recommend these for attending voice calls.\nRead more', '\nTitle: A Reliable Choice for Wireless EarbudsRating: ★★★★☆ (4/5)I recently purchased a pair of true wireless earbuds, and after using them for a while, I can confidently say that they offer a satisfying listening experience with a few minor drawbacks.Pros:1. Sound Quality (★★★★☆): The sound quality of these earbuds is impressive, with clear highs and punchy bass. They provide an immersive audio experience, making music and podcasts enjoyable.2. Comfort (★★★★☆): The earbuds are comfortable to wear for extended periods. They come with multiple ear tip options, ensuring a snug fit and good passive noise isolation.3. Connectivity (★★★★☆): Pairing is straightforward, and the Bluetooth connection remains stable. The earbuds quickly connect to my devices, which is convenient.4. Battery Life (★★★☆☆): The battery life is decent, offering several hours of playback on a single charge. The charging case provides additional hours, making them suitable for daily use.Cons:1. Build Quality (★★★☆☆): While they feel lightweight and compact, the build quality leaves something to be desired. The plastic construction feels a bit flimsy, and I worry about their long-term durability.2. Touch Controls (★★★☆☆): The touch controls can be a bit finicky. Sometimes, accidental touches occur when adjusting the earbuds, which can be frustrating.3. Microphone (★★☆☆☆): The microphone quality is below par, particularly in noisy environments. Call quality suffers, and it can be challenging for others to hear you clearly.4. Limited Features (★★★☆☆): Compared to premium models, these earbuds lack some advanced features like active noise cancellation or advanced app integration.In summary, these true wireless earbuds are a reliable and budget-friendly choice for those seeking good sound quality and comfort. They are a suitable option for music enthusiasts and casual users. However, if you prioritize durability, advanced features, or crystal-clear call quality, you might want to consider higher-end alternatives.\nRead more']}{'title': '        ZEBRONICS Duke 60hrs Playtime Bluetooth Wireless Over Ear Headphone with Mic (Black)       ', 'reviews': ["\nLike you, i was scrolling through the comments to see if i should buy this or not. The reviews are very polarising (either good or bad) and to my surprise neither were truly wrong. So i was skeptical but i found it on sale for 999 so i just bought it.. I will do a pros and cons first and a super detailed review after it (the review will be given keeping the price range of 1500-2000 in mind)Pros:- Build Quality- Sound Quality (after EQ) [Amazing Bass, crystal clear and lively vocals with ear-fatigue free & nice treble tones]- Battery Life- Dual Connectivity and stable connection- No noticeable latency in videos- Comfort- Sick RGBCons:- Mic Quality-Sound Quality (without EQ) [Amazing Bass, Bad vocals, Bad treble tones]-Low battery indications every 60 secs after 20% (didn't say 1 min as people might take it as an exaggeration)- You cant change or keep 1 colour on rgb, it changes on its own- Few Service Centres- Sometimes the headphones goes into a weird state where you have to keep the power button pressed for 10-30 seconds for it to work againMinor cons (which are completely fine for the price but are worth mentioning)-the rgb also turns on each time you power on the headphone so turning it off for more battery gets a bit annoying-The earcups dont fold (if you want to keep them on your neck then you will have to extend them , after that they wont restrict your head movement)-Each time you start/turn off the headphones or it connects/disconnects there is a voice announcement which i found to be quite annoyingDETAILED REVIEW1) Build Quality: The headband is made of made up of metal and looks very sturdy. The plastic used on the earcups is also of a good quality and i don't think it will break easily. The wire that is visible is thick and i aint worried about it. The earcups dont fold (which i knew) but it could have been a good addition.  The cushioning on the headband is minimal but soft so you wont have a problem there. The ear cushions are very soft. Dimensions of entire ear cushion 10cm x 8cm . Dimensions of the opening for our ears 5.6cm x 4cm.The buttons wobble a little bit in their place but are clicky & tactile. The box it comes in, is very Sturdy and can be used to keep the headphone.2) Looks: The headphone has a sick matte black colour which i love, the side profile looks amazing, it does look a bit bulky and weird when you look at it from the front though.3) Comfort:  I thought the hole should be as big as my ear to be comfortable which was not the case, my ear is like 6 cm and it still fits inside (with unnoticeable bending as the hole does get a bit bigger inside due to the pressure of our earlobes against it). The headphone does not feel heavy at all. The clamping force is just enough to keep the headphone from slipping, it isn't much which increases the comfort. The earcup wobbles a bit for a comfortable angle on your head. The clicks to increase or decrease the size are tight so the size wont change when you shake your head. I didn't have any discomfort wearing it for 4-5 hours straight. Although, the ears do sweat after 2-3 hours in normal temperature so you have to take a break of 2 mins (it doesnt feel warm but the sweat can speed up the wear and tear of the ear cushions. the way i do it is to just let out the air inside the headphones every once in like 30 mins for 15 secs which is much more efficient)Note: If its your first time wearing an over ear headphone then it might take a couple of days to get used to the weight and clamping force. Also, like all over ear headphones, they will be tight out of the box but they will loosen up after several hours of use (you can just put it on a pillow in between the earcushions instead if your head overnight)4) Battery Life: I think it goes upto 20-22 hours on higher volumes (can be used only till 20% is left, after that unusable due to voice alerts)5) Charging Time: Takes about 1hr 45 mins to go from 20% to 100%6) Connectivity: I tried going into another room and it worked just fine so don't worry about the range. This headphone has dual connectivity which isn't mentioned anywhere, you can connect with 2 devices and if you play something with 1 device, the other pauses and vice versa7) Latency: There is no noticeable latency in most videos or movies (there is a very slight delay which you can notice if you try noticing it hard but you wont do that while watching anything so its safe to say there is no noticeable latency, the latency can also be noticed if the person talks really fast)8) Gaming: When you do gaming via bluetooth you will notice the latency like pretty much every wireless product without a gaming mode of 80ms latency. You can make out where the sound is coming from pretty easily. You can use the aux to get 0 latency.9) Mic: The mic is straight up bad, lacks both clarity and loudness (Do note that the mic won't work with the aux cable)10) Sound Isolation: You can't really hear anything of outside if something is playing in your headphones. If the volume is loud the people around you can hear it which is a con, other headphones do a better job here11) Sound Quality (without EQ): The bass is very powerful, perfect for bass lovers but the mids and highs aren't even good12) Sound Quality (with basic EQ):The Sound is loud enough at 100% for pretty much anyone who does not have significant hearing loss. The bass can be made less powerful or even more powerful if you want to blast your skull with the bass. The mids are produced very nicely. The highs are on point (neither sharp nor dull, its sparky enough without causing ear fatigue). The clarity is also very nice, the sounds seems crystal clear and crispy The distortion is very less.(Note: My Basic EQ is just take the little dots in the right half and increase all of them to some extent, keep the leftmost dot where it was and try to make a straight line between the leftmost and middle dots with the other dots left in the left half). One thing to note is that, you will find that the headphone skipped a word, its random and not that often but its worth mentioning13) Sound quality via aux: The same things apply here but the max volume is 90% of what it was via bluetooth and the clarity gets a boost if you play FLAC format music1 Year Edit for Durability: Everything still stands true, the earcup vinyl (i think that is the material) startedcoming off suddenly after 10 months i think and now its gone but it doesnt make a difference to sound or comfort. It randomly stopped working, i think the power button disconnected so i sent them via courier to the service centre (in warranty) and they sent it back in a week i think. I dropped them twice from 3 feet and it stayed fine, but someone sat on my headphones and one side got de-attached from the headband held on just by wire, it then dropped twice after that and that one side stopped working. I tried contacting service centres about how much the repair will cost so that i dont end up spending 400 or something to get this headphone repaired when i bought it for 999 but they didnt respond so i can spend either 100 to get this to the service centre by courier (most companies have a pick up service like soundcore) or go 20km away to get it repaired myself (which is hard during covid).

And for audio volume level, It gives hearable sound in just 18% of computer audio and when i increase audio upto 100 i can hear even the base from 40cm far from the headphones.As for comfort The cushions are really good, i was able to keep it on ears for 3hrs but not more than that cause it mae my head feel dizzy cause of hearing all my favourate melodies, old school, hip hop, rap and metal songs all at once LOL, But like other headphones i bought this one is stiff and feels like it will break if pressurised to stretch .As for looks I love the RGB and the grill metal look it gives is DOPE along with plastic matte cover. It is quiet big like having two black and glowing eggs attached to ears but its worth cause the big egg things has lot of BASS inside LOL.The battery life is incredible, I have been using it since yesterday and it still have 50% battery left.ONLY PROBLEM is that I found the audio has sharp voice somewhat maximised to keep up with that heavy bass, like when you hear a song you will hear the vocals in sharp voice which is not actually pleasant. I counter this problem by using an equilizer in phone and laptop by decreasing the 14 KHz to some level and increasing 910 Hz to some level. And it only happens in bluetooth mode, The aux is perfect though.Apart from all this I love my new headphone, Zebronics done a fabulous job by making it and selling it in such an affordable price.\nRead more']}{'title': '        boAt Rockerz 551ANC Hybrid Active Noise Cancellation Headphones with Up to 100H Playtime, ASAP™ Charge, Ambient Sound Mode &Dual EQ Modes, ENx™ Technology(Stellar Black)       ', 'reviews': ["\nThese (Rockerz ANC 551) headphones are for this price segment.

Feels a little bulky after 2 hours (tip: use in intervals), ear piece fits perfectly over the ear. In winter it will not get sweat around ear but in summers definitely, but it's sort of waterproof didn't absorb the sweat.Battery is definitely long lasting (at 50% lasts around 10 days after using for 5 hours daily), volume at 50% is enough for music listening. Music highs & lows are perfectly balanced not too bass (tip: set enhancements when using on laptop/phone), after some custom settings bass feels good. Didn't require ANC much after wearing it, but its good at this price range, also it does feel like there is some vaccum created around ears, wouldn't use for long duration.

The bass is robust, and the high frequencies, while slightly louder than my preference, still deliver a clear sound. Cymbal sounds are notably prominent, occasionally to the point of being loud. Across various music genres such as Rock, Jazz, Pop, Indian Classical, and Bollywood, the headphones performed admirably, except for rock music, which I found a bit harsh. However, this can be fine-tuned through the SOUNDCORE app, which provides built-in EQ presets and the option to create custom presets. Overall, considering the price point, these headphones offer exceptional audio quality.Design - 4/5The headphones sport an eye-catching design. Their fit and finish are commendable, although the buttons feel a bit clunky. On the other hand, the touch sensor is highly sensitive and responsive. The black and gold combination, especially the logo, exudes a premium aesthetic.Comfort - 4/5In terms of comfort, these headphones shine. You can wear them all day without any discomfort. The memory foam cushions are thick and plush, providing a comfortable experience for extended use.Battery - 4/5The battery life is excellent. Out of the box, the battery had a decent charge and lasted for more than 15 hours. A full charge is expected to yield an impressive 35-40 hours with ANC (Active Noise Cancellation) activated.Features - 3.5/5ANC performs adequately, effectively reducing external noise, but it falls short of greatness. Call quality was initially subpar, with low volume, which improved after charging and resetting the headphones. Bluetooth connectivity is swift, thanks to the fast-connect feature, ensuring a seamless connection as soon as Bluetooth is activated.VerdictIn conclusion, these headphones are a compelling choice at their price point.

Una maravilla. Aguantan muchísimo. Usándolos casi toda la tarde y parte de la mañana solamente los cargo 1 vez a la semana. Además, cargan rápido.- Comodidad. Otra maravilla. Las orejas no duelen porque quedan completamente cubiertas, y la diadema es más ancha que las habituales, así que no presiona tanto sobre la parte superior del cráneo, que a veces molesta también con otros cascos cuando llevas unas cuantas horas usándolos.- Cancelación de ruido. Es bastante bastante buena. Cancela mejor los sonidos agudos y medios que los graves, pero aún así hace un muy buen trabajo con los graves. En mi caso, muy aprovechados para poder estudiar cuando hay obras, vecinos molestos que no se callan, mi hermano que es flautista. Para poder darme un paseo completamente aislado. Y el resultado es muy muy bueno. Te quitan aproximadamente un 70 - 80 % del ruido ambiental. Y si les subes el volumen un poco, lo eliminas por completo.Son el punto fuerte de estos cascos. Yo la tengo siempre activa la cancelación de ruido (ANC). El modo normal consume algo menos de batería, pero ¿para qué te vas a comprar unos cascos con cancelación de ruido si luego no la usas?- Calidad del sonido. Si le he puesto un 4 en vez de 5 cinco a este apartado de la valoración es porque el usuario tiene que manipular un poco el producto. Me explico.Para poner a funcionar los cascos debes descargar la app de Soundcore. La configuración predeterminada es bastante mala y el sonido es pobre, por no decir otra cosa. Lo bueno es que la misma app tiene un ecualizador que te permite solucionar este problema.Basta ir a la personalización del ecualizador y darle al + (Crear perfil EQ).He probado las 10 configuraciones que hay por ahí rulando en la web (las subo todas al final del comentario por si alguien quiere probarlas) y como conclusión extraigo las siguientes 2 configuraciones:Iluminar-3.5 / 4 / 6 / 6 / 4.5 / 5 / 6 / 6Oscurecer-3.5 / 6 / 2. 5 / 3.5 / 2.5 / 6 / 6 / 4.5El perfil "Iluminar" es todoterreno. Lo puedes poner por defecto y funciona bien con casi cualquier tipo de canción. Si alguna canción te resulta muy estridente (porque de base ya tiene muchos agudos esa canción), puedes seleccionar el modo "Oscurecer", que las suaviza un poco.¿Cómo saber cuándo un medidor se encuentra en el punto 2.5 o -3.5 etc?El cursor de cada frecuencia funciona por redondeo, es decir, para seleccionar 2.5, empezamos a subir el cursor desde el 0. Conforme suba, marcará 1, luego 2 y así sucesivamente. ¿Cuándo paramos? En el punto exacto en el que pasa de 2 a 3, ese punto es 2.5Conforme subes el cursor, lo que hace es ir tomando valores 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4 (para todos estos valores, mostrará que vale 2) Como funciona por redondeo, cuando llega a 2.5 aparece el 3.De igual forma, si queremos el -3.5, vamos bajando desde el -3 y el primer punto en el que aparezca -4 será el -3.5De hecho es más fácil establecer una frecuencia en 2.5 que en 2. Para alcanzar un 2, será más o menos la mitad entre 2.5 y 3.5 o, simplemente, un poquillo más arriba que el 1.5Por si a alguien no le convencen esas configuraciones, aquí hay una recopilación de las configuraciones que hay rulando por ahí en foros, vídeos y demás. Aunque ya digo que después de mucho testear, me quedo con las dos que he puesto arriba (que son producto de modificar y juguetear con algunas de las de aquí abajo)1 / 3 / 2.5 / 2.5 / 3 / 3.5 / 2 / 2.5-6 / 4 / 4.5 / 4 / 2.5 / 6 / 2.5 / 2.5-3 / -2.5 / 3 / 3.5 / 4.5 / -2-6 / 6 / 2.5 / 2.5 / 1.5 / 3.5 / 0 / -2.5-4 / 3.5 / 6 / 6 / 4.5 / 5 / 4 / 6-6 / -1 / 2 / 0 / 1 / 3.5 / -1 / 0-3 / 2 / 4 / 5 / 5 / 4 / -3 / 0-5.5 / 3 / -1.5 / 5.5 / -2 / 3.5 / 4 / -6-1.5 / 4 / 3 / 3 / 2.5 / 4 / 4 / 4-5.5 / 3.5 / -1.5 / 5.5 / -2 / 3.5 / 2 / 0\nRead more', '\nMinha análise abaixo, O HYPE É REAL!Qualidade sonora:(NOTA 9.9)Vou explicar por que não é 10. Não é 10 por que o equalizador stock (padrão) que já vem no fone não é muito bom na minha opinião, pois destaca somente frequências graves e subgraves e anula todas as outras. Mas é possível corrigir isso pelo o aplicativo da soundcore, equalizando do seu jeito, pois com o uso do aplicativo isso é possível, outra razão é que em algumas músicas seu agudo fica bem forte ao ponto de incomodar, mas de toda maneira, também é possível regular isso por meio do equalizador. Gostei muito da qualidade sonora! graves, médios e agudos impecáveis! com destaque para os subgraves! (ATENÇÃO: Você só terá essa qualidade sonora com o ANC desativado)Modo de transparência(10):Amei esse modo, super útil e funciona muito bem, capta bem os sons externos, uso bastante para não ter que tirar o fone da cabeça, além de que é bem fácil ativá-lo e rápido, já que só basta tocar a concha direita do fone por 1s e já altera para o modo transparência.Duração da Bateria(10):Incrível! Dura bastante, serve bem para todo tipo de uso! bateria perfeita, não há reclamações quanto a isso.Design(8,5): Muito lindo, robusto, design mais minimalista e quase tudo de plástico, (com exceção do arco de metal) que mesmo sendo de plástico, ainda assim consegue dar um ar de fone Premium, realmente. Contudo, vi análises na internet que esse fone não é muito resistente quanto parece, de acordo com que ouvi falar, os fones em suas dobradiças depois de um médio tempo de uso começam a se quebrar, porém, vi uma maneira de resolver isso, e é simples, como vocês podem ver na foto, o fone acompanha uma case onde ele sempre está dobrado e encolhido, o que pode com médio prazo forçar as dobradiças do fone ao ponto de racharem e talvez quebrarem, por isso, eu sei que é um acessório, mas recomendo não guardar o fone sempre a case ou evitar dobra-lo muitas vezes, por que isso pode forçar e fazer ele quebrar as dobradiças. Por isso, cuidado, mas se você tiver zelo vale a pena pagar o preço por este fone, porque ele é muito incrível em som e em design, e é resistente o suficiente, só lembre-se de não forçar as dobradiças. Um adendo é que esse fone atrai marcas de dedo.Conchas de couro sintético(9,0):São muito confortáveis, dão um isolamento passivo já bastante suficiente para se isolar um pouco do mundo, enfim não tenho muito o que falar, elas realmente cobriram toda minha orelha com folga (tenho orelha pequena, contudo acho que ficará tudo bem se tiver orelhas maiores) e são bastante confortáveis e macias, muito boas mesmo, porém, infelizmente possuem problemas também, Por ser couro sintético, se o usuário não ter zelo, em menos de um ano já podem apresentar descascamento e aí seria necessário trocar, porém outros fones concorrentestambém apresentam esse problema, então não há como fugir disso, mas ainda assim, apresenta uma boa qualidade, muito boas mesmo.ANC(Cancelamento de ruídos)(7.0)Não gostei muito, é Ok, mas longe de ser ruim hein?, serve para alguns momentos como para assistir vídeos ou só se vc quiser se isolar mesmo, ele funciona e realmente te isola do ambiente, e vai atender a maioria dos usuários. Contudo, ao ouvir músicas com frequências mais graves, não gostei de uma caracterisica que o fone apresentou, pois pude notar que frequências mais agudas e graves ficam  mais apagadas, apesar que a qualidade ainda se mantém muito boa,  isso ainda dá uma certa aparência de som menos encorpado.  Além disso, ao aumentar o volume perto do máximo ou no máximo, nota-se que o fone na tentativa de entregar graves, acaba por entregar um grave muito punch (Soco), e ainda mais é um punch distorcido e que me incomodou e por isso evito de usar o noise cancelling quando estou ouvindo música. No geral não gostei muito, mas era o esperado pela faixa de preço e sim, pelo o preço funciona muito bem, e se você gosta de ASMR esse fone é perfeito para tal, ou de estudar ou apenas se desligar mais do mundo.Aperto na cabeça (10)Ele não aperta muito na cabeça, somente o suficiente para o fone se manter preso na cabeça, e isso é fantástico! (na minha opinião) ele é diferente de outros fones concorrentes. É necessário um grande esforço para que ele caia de sua cabeça, então realmente muito bom!Adendos:1.O fone treme na cabeça, se você não gosta disso, talvez não queira este fone, (mas é normal para fones desse tamanho isso ocorrer), porém em minha experiência achei isso muito bom, dá uma maior imersão no áudio.2.Sobre o áudio p2 é bom mas fica com volume ligeiramente inferior ao bluetooth. E infelizmente as funções no modo P2 de noise cancelling, equalizador, dentre outros ficam indisponíveis, uma vez que o fone fica totalmente desligado quando isto é usado.3.Para realizar chamadas eu gostei bastante do áudio, bem alto e de boa definição, sendo bem bom para realizar reuniões no zoom, meet e dentre outros programas.4.Os Codecs desse fone são: SBC, AAC + HD AUDIO, o que é muito bom, pois vários fones adotam o SBC, que só entrega uma qualidade mediana, mas que também não é ruim. Já o ACC é utilizado em Iphones por exemplo e funciona muito bem por aqui, a qualidade é superior de áudio, e por incrível que pareça para jogos funciona muito bem, o seu delay em minha experiência foi até que melhor que o esperado, mas, pode ser ruim para alguns usuários, pois esse fone não oferece nenhuma função de diminuição de Delay para jogos, pois ele não foi feito para esse público.4.O bluetooth adotado aqui é 5.0, muito bom e com boa estabilidade, não tive problemas5. Seus botões são muito bons, rapidamente você é capaz de se acostumar, e funcionam bem para as funções que lhe foram designadas.6. Em relação ao atendimento ao cliente da OCTO SHOP BR, amei muito, pois todas minhas dúvidas foram respondidas rapidamente e eles procuraram me ajudar o máximo possível! muito obrigado pelo o incrível atendimento, e em relação aos correios, vai depender da sua sorte, mas comigo veio antes do prazo e tudo certinho, sem a caixa estar amassada nem nada, além de que não há necessidade de se preucupar com taxação, já que a própria loja já cuida disso.Resumo: Enfim, recomendo este fone sim com toda certeza de olhos fechados, tem seus problemas como qualquer coisa na vida, mas é muito bom mesmo, mais do que recomendado, O HYPE É REAL!É isso espero ter ajudado alguém a comprar ou a não comprar este fone.\nRead more', '\nEs difícil encontrar un auricular hoy día la verdad. Mil reviews (muchas de ellas pagadas con el producto gratis), y mil modelos tanto de bluetooth como de cable.En el audio el más dinero suele ir relacionado con el mejor calidad. Por eso si no podemos en ese momento o no nos apetece comprar algo demasiado caro, la amplitud de modelos a elegir no se reduce.Esta reseña parte de la base de que un auricular bluetooth jamás nos dará la calidad de audio de uno con cable por muy bueno o avanzado que sea el codec que utilice. En base a eso, en Internet hay un modelo en el que la mayoría de los compradores (o reseñadores de pago) están de acuerdo, Soundcore Life Q30.Después de la tralla que os he dado, al turrón, puntualizaré lo que quiero destacar:- Audio, graves, muchísimos graves. Olvidaos de la respuesta plana (cosa que yo prefiero y me encanta) o de predominancia de agudos. Soundcore le da mucha presencia de graves a este modelo sea el perfil que sea el que elijamos en la ecualización. Por supuesto indagando un poco por la red encontraremos la ecualización perfecta para obtener un sonido HiFi (con las diferencia existentes al no tener codec LDAC el cual sólo está en su hermano mayor de 100€, el Q35). La pongo al final de la reseña. Es por ello que evitad los comentarios en los que ponen pegas al producto por su graves. Se pueden reducir muchísimo y una de las gracias que tiene el producto es la personalización en su sonido. ¿Y por qué me quedo con el modelo si hay que afinar tanto la ecualización? Seguid leyendo.- Ecualizador, como comenté antes, gracias a él mismo podemos aumentar agudos, hacer más plano el sonido, potenciar graves (más aún de como vienen de fábrica), etc, una virguería.- Cancelación de sonido. Las cosas claras, no son los Sony XM3 o XM4, que no os engañen, pero por 59.95€ no existe nada igual en el mercado. El ANC funciona sorprendentemente bien y con gran calidad respecto al audio, por lo que no lo empeora.- Comodidad, todos los auriculares de diadema meten calor en la orejas, ya sea por la piel sintética o por la tela si es el caso. En verano todos nos dará calor, en invierno lógicamente menos. Una vez obviado esto las espumas parecen foam blandito que se adaptan a la cabeza super bien y no te enteras apenas que los llevas puesto, un 10 por el fabricante la verdad.- Bolsa de almacenaje, aquí no me ha gustado nada lo que ha hecho Soundcore. En las reviews del producto venía una bolsa distinta a la que están dando ahora. Antes tenía la forma de los auriculares en una especie de foam y con un bolsillo para los cables, ahora (ved foto adjunta) no es así y no hay bolsillo para los cables sino un bolsito que se cierra. Muy mal, de hecho les he escrito para comentarles el detalle, a ver qué me dicen.- Cable, el audio por cable es normalito, no son unos Audio Technica ni unos Beyerdynamics, da tanta calidad como por bluetooth pero sólo ellos lo saben, en la última actualización 2.30 se han cargado el ANC con la conexión cableada. Espero que lo solucionen.En resumen, no hay nada mejor por 60 euros, así de simple. Puedes probar 100 marcas, pero es que ni los Sony bluetooth de 30/50 euros se acercan a la personalización de sonido o al ANC que tienen los Q30. Reconozco que me desencanté mucho al ponerlos en funcionamiento y ver tantos graves, pero cuando consigues ecualizarlos, son una delicia. Y si a alguien le cabe duda, SÍ, el auricular lo compré de mi bolsillo 100%.NOTA: La ecualización la podéis poner así = -6, +5, +4, +2, +2, +6, 0, +1\nRead more', '\nBuena calidad de construcción, almohadillas cómodas pero de espuma de poca densidad lo que repercute en un aislamiento pasivo del ruido mejorable. La diadema és ancha, yo tengo un cabezón y no me aprieta nada, preferiría que el ajuste fuera más firme, aunque va a gustos.La aplicación muy bien, permite actualizar firmware, elegir ecualizador, crear uno a tu gusto y está la función de escuchar sonidos relajantes de la naturaleza, con o son anc, muy buena idea.El sonido és bueno por el precio, con cuerpo. Tienes muchas opciones de ecualización pre-fijadas si bien yo funciono con las que he creado yo, a mi gusto. Recomiendo ésta última opción para tener un sonido adaptado a tu gusto.Respecto a la cancelación de sonido, decir 2 cosas.La 1a que és flojilla, no cancela mucho aunque de notarse se nota,pero poca cosa, no entiendo las muchas reviews que dicen que es tan buena... claro que por el precio no podemos ir de tiquis-miquis.La 2a cosa y , lo que más me ha decepcionado de este auricular, és que el sonido con el anc conectado és malo. El campo se estrecha un mundo, suena como si escucharas a través de un tubo, el sonido se transforma a peor por lo que mejor escucharlo con el anc desconectado, mucho mejor.Me daré unos dias más para darle rodaje y ver que tal, si no mejoran los devolveré. No tiene sentido que unos auriculares con anc y buen sonido, se vuelvan malos una vez conectas el anc.Addenda1.Después de 2 dias de uso intensivo puedo matizar el problema con el anc. Hay un problema de software , que no sé si afecta a todos, o a un lote de auriculares en particular, ya que he visto reviews de otros usuarios que les sucede lo mismo. El tema es que cuando cambias entre los modos anc de ‘interior’ _‘exterior’ se escucha el sonido mal, como a lata. Por ejemplo,  si estás en el modo ‘interior’ de la anc y pasas a ‘exterior’ el sonido se vuelve pésimo,  O al activar la anc desde el modo normal que suena a lata. O si estás en anc i la quitas volviendo al modo normal, se escucha a lata unos segundos y luego por sí solo y sin tocar nada vuelve a oirse bien.En resumen, hay fallos de sonido en la transición entre modos anc i al activar el anc. Espero lo solucionen en la próxima actualización de firmware, sinó los devolveré.Addenda 2Después de contactar con el servicio técnico y decirme que pruebe a reiniciar los auriculares o que lo vincule a otro móvil, me sigue pasando el mismo error. Devueltos.Addenda 3Después de lo sucedido, el servicio técnico me envió otro auricular de prueba pudiendo verificar que los anteriores me vinieron defectuosos. Ahora se escuchan estupendamente (por el precio) y no dan ningún tipo de problema cuando cambio entre tipos de cancelación de ruido. Gracias por la excelencia del servicio post-venta, un 10. Ahora sí puedo recomendarlos honestamente.\nRead more', "\nImballo e tempi di spedizione come tradizione Amazon. Le mie cuffie ordinate la sera sono arrivate la mattina del giorno dopo. Esperienza d'uso completamente soddisfatto. Funzionalità, occorre fare lamano ai tasti che sono piccoli ma ben disposti, solidi e con un feedback tattile ottimo. Comprate ad occhi shiusi, rapporto qualità/prezzo/prestazioni senza eguali.Se volete leggere nello specifico prestazioni, dati tecnici e consigli di uso, proseguite.La scatola di imballo, contiene una custodia semi-rigida in tessuto mesh del peso di gr 422 (cuffie ed accessori) con chiusura a zip con cuciture ricoperte da una fettuccia, una targhetta cucita sul bordo interno, con stilizzate le cuffie, indica in che posizione vanno rimesse a posto. Esternamente è cucina una cinghia ad anello per il trasporto (quindi non il solito sacchetto morbido in vellutino).All’interno della custodia sono presenti le cuffie gr 267 (fate una foto per capire come vanno rimesse a posto – oppure vedi foto allegata alla recensione, ovvero, l’archetto va appoggiato sul supporto in gomma presente nella custodia e non all’interno di esso). In un sacchettino di velluto, sono presenti cavo di ricarica di 60 cm da USB ad USB – C (senza spina che va comprata a parte oppure usate quella del vostro cellulare o tablet) ed cavo audio cm 128 con il jack da 3,5 mm per il collegamento senza bluetooth ad una entrata audio.L’archetto regolabile con scatti precisi, è in metallo e ben imbottito nella parte che poggia sulla testa. I padiglioni, con driver da 40 cm, sono di un materiale in simil-pelle traspirante e molto morbido, che poggia sulla testa circondando il padiglione, creando un effetto “ventosa” leggero e piacevole ed isolando in parte, meccanicamente, dai rumori esterni. Le cuffie sono stabili muovendo la testa e la regolazione dell’archetto è stabile.PADIGLIONE SINISTRO: sono presenti la presa USB – C per la ricarica, vicino al bottone di accensione (premere per accendere, tenere premuto per spegnere fino alla accensione di un led rosso) che serve anche per l’accoppiamento Bluetooth, tenere premuto qualche secondo, fino alla accensione di un led blu e bianco alternati, che avvisano della ricerca di dispositivi bluetooth nelle vicinanze, quando la luce blu sola lampeggia, indica che l’accoppiamento è eseguito con successo, ed il tasto per la funzione di “Cancellazione del Rumore” in tre modalità:TOTALE: tutti i rumori vengono cancellati.TRASPARENZA: si sentono i rumori esterni “captati” dai 4 microfoni presenti sulle cuffie, utile per sentire una persona che ci parla o mentre si passeggia per sentire le macchine.SPENTO: cancellazione passiva, ovvero i rumori si sentono volume ed udito permettendo.Poggiando un dispositivo NFC sulla parte esterna del padiglione sinistro, è possibile fare l’accoppiamento istantaneo senza usare la ricerca con il bluetooth.Ogni volta che viene premuto il tasto “CN” una voce in cuffia ci avvisa della modalità attivata.PADIGLIONE DESTRO: ci sono i bottoni del Volume Su e Volume Giù (per riconoscerlo ha un pallino in rilievo) che se premuti in maniera prolungata cambiano traccia andando avanti o indietro nell’elenco delle tracce, un terzo bottone con funzione Play/Pausa, se premuto in maniera prolungata, attiva l’Assistente Vocale, veramente funzionante. Infine vi è l’entrata per il cavo audio.Pigiando qualche secondo, sulla parte esterna del padiglione si attiva la funzione “Trasparenza” (ovvero, i microfoni della cuffia fanno sentire i rumori ambientali che ci circondano in cuffia), pigiando di nuovo si disattiva tornando alla impostazione precedentemente impostata. Una voce nella cuffia ci avvisa della modalità “Trasparenza Disattivata/Attivata”.Il tutto è accompagnato dalla applicazione “Soundcore Life Q30” scaricabile sul sito del produttore, per Android ed Apple.La applicazione permette di:- Equalizzare le cuffie con 22 Preset non sovra-scrivibili, ma modificabili e salvabili con altro nome, quindi in tutto 44 equalizzazioni possibili.- Funzione “Qualità del Sonno” con 11 suoni ambientali (pioggia, vento, suoni della montagna, etc) sovrapponibili ed equalizzabili nella loro sovrapposizione, ovvero un suono più forte e l’altro più delicato, con timer ed auto-spegnimento completamente personalizzabili. Utile per esempio quando ci si deve concentrare o quando ci si vuole rilassare per studiare o per leggere un bel libro.- “Rumore Bianco” sono dei preset di suoni creati da voi o dalla Comunity, eh già, perché con l’app ci si può collegare anche ad una comunity di persone che usano i prodotti Anker, (cuffie ed altro) con un forum dedicato per chiedere consigli.ATTENZIONE: se le cuffie vengono collegate con il cavo ad una fonte audio, il bluetooth si disattiva e la applicazione “Soundcore Life Q30” non può essere usata cosi come tutte le impostazioni dell’equalizzatore delle cuffie, dovrete quindi usare l’equalizzatore della periferica alla quale siete collegati tramite cavo ed il microfono della periferica alla quale siete collegati tramite cavo audio, per parlare.Le cuffie sono dotate di protocollo bluetooth 5 quindi, possono essere collegate contemporaneamente a due periferiche differenti contemporaneamente, posto che entrambe abbiano il bluetooth 5, ed ovviamente funzionerà una periferica alla volta. Quindi potete vedere un film sul pc e tenere collegato il cellulare e con le cuffie ascoltare e parlare nel caso di chiamata in arrivo sul cellulare.Nel caso l’accoppiamento con una periferica non funzionasse, tenete premuto il tasto di accensione e il tasto di Volume Su per resettarle fino a quando il led lampeggia ripetutamente rosso e blu. Non occorrerà rifare l’accoppiamento in altre periferiche già accoppiate, si resettano solo le cuffie.DATI TECNICI:- Silk Diaphragm Drivers da 40mm certificati Hi-Res Audio. Questo significa che le cuffie possono riprodurre l'intero spettro dell'Audio Hi-Res (assumendo che il file musicale che state ascoltando sia anch'esso Hi-Res), ovvero, superano le specifiche dei CD audio, e cioè 16 bit di profondità e 44,1 kHz di frequenza di campionamento.In genere l'orecchio umano può udire i suoni nell'intervallo di frequenza che va dai 20 Hz ai 20000 Hz, anche se molti adulti non sono in grado di sentire sopra i 16000 Hz avere un range più elevato  16Hz – 40kHz consiste in una qualità sonora veramente elevata, equiparabile solo con cuffie di ben altra fascia di prezzo.- Impedenza 16 Ω . Se collegate tramite cavo, la resa in frequenza, sarà più elevata rispetto a cuffie con impedenza maggiore, ad esempio 32 Ω come la maggior parte delle cuffie da studio. In parole semplici, se le cuffie le userete collegate tramite cavo audio con telefono e/o tablet quanto più l’impedenza è minore tanto meno sarà la corrente richiesta per funzionare e quindi necessiterete di meno volume per sentire le cuffie. Quindi con periferiche come cellulari e tablet il volume di ascolto sarà maggiore in quanto le cuffie necessiteranno di meno alimentazione.- Bluetooth 5.0 (range di 15 metri) quindi possibilità di connessione con due dispositivi contemporaneamente.- Digital Hybrid ANC, Multi-mode Noise Cancellation.- Possibilità di aggiornare il firmware delle cuffie se disponibile tramite la applicazione Soundcore.- Funzione Transparency, ovvero i microfoni sui padiglioni riproducono in cuffia i rumori ambientali sovrapposti alla sorgente audio che stiamo ascoltando.- supporto all’NFC, possibilità di accoppiare le cuffie a dispositivi provvisti di NFC. Non è possibile fare l’accoppiamento con NFC se le cuffie sono collegate tramite cavo.- 2 microfoni per le chiamate.- porta USB Type-C per la ricarica, che avviene in circa 2 ore,  ATTENZIONE quando sono in carica le cuffie non si possono usare neanche con il cavo. Per usarle con il  cavo occorre un minimo di ricarica, considerando che supporta la RICARICA VELOCE in solo 5 minuti di carica 4 ore di utilizzo, il problema non si pone.- batteria 720 mAh. 40 ore di riproduzione musicale con ANC attivato (60 ore con ANC disattivato).- Audio codec supportati SBC, AAC, i codec aptX non sono supportati quindi niente audio Flac, dovrete rivolgervi al modello superiore le Q35 ma ad altri costi.ATTENZIONESe utilizzate le cuffie in bluetooth, su di un pc per ascoltare dei video e contemporaneamente le avete collegate al telefono sempre in bluetooth, per rispondere alle chiamate, disabilitate il microfono del pc, altrimenti interferisce con il microfono delle cuffie ed in chiamata avrete un fastidioso eco di ritorno. Contemporaneamente, abilitate sul pc le cuffie come solo audio (icona delle cuffie senza il microfono) perché le cuffie collegate come “hand set” (icona cuffie con microfono) hanno un suono mono che viene riprodotto uguale in entrambi i padiglioni, quindi niente effetto stereo.Se usate il pc sia per video-chiamate ed fruizione video e musica e siete collegati anche con il telefono (a meno di non convivere con il ritorno eco in cuffia), abilitate nella scheda audio del pc le cuffie come periferica audio e voce, (icona con le cuffie e microfono) ed anche come periferica audio e disabilitate il microfono del pc. Al contempo abilitate le cuffie sul telefono come auricolare, non come “handset”. Potrete ascoltare sul pc la musica o i video in stereo e parlare tramite le cuffie quando riceverete una telefonata video sul pc e potrete rispondere ad una chiamata sul cellulare ascoltando la chiamata in cuffia e parlando nel microfono del cellulare.ATTENZIONE:Se collegate le cuffie tramite cavo, potrete collegarvi ad una sola periferica, il bluetooth si spegne e così anche i microfoni delle cuffie, dovrete quindi usare il microfono della periferica alla quale siete collegati tramite cavo.Preferite il cavo se siete amanti del buon suono ma il Bluetooth va più che bene in ogni altro caso.Se avete altri dubbi, sul sito del produttore troverete dei video di istruzioni per ogni funzione delle cuffie ed un forum con una comunity molto vasta per porre qualsiasi quesito attinente alle cuffie.\nRead more"]}{'title': '        HAMMER Bash Max Over The Ear Wireless Bluetooth Headphones with Mic, Touch Control, Deep Bass, Upto 18 Hours Playtime, Bluetooth 5.3, Workout/Travel (Black)       ', 'reviews': ["\nHonestly this headphone is ratio'd by Noise Two in almost every single aspect.And just so you know it doesn't look nearly as good as in photos.Albeit, it's not a bad headphone by any means.Despite Noise Two being better, I'm keeping this one cuz it can swivel.Its also slightly more comfortable than that since it larger ear cups.As far as touch controls are concerned, they aren't faulty or anything, you just have to get used to it.\nRead more", "\nFirst thing about this product is this is very comfortable around your ears and plus this product is worth if you looking for very comfy headphones then should definitely but this and the best part is sound quality of this product is amazing mind-blowing go for it guys and don't worry about battery life it stays till 2-3 days\nRead more", '\nThis products sound quality is really very good.

The built quality is amazing, all around it's plastic with foam on the headband but it's very sturdy, the headband is not too loose, slightly tight but it does loosen up a bit eventually2. Comfort - The ear foams are ok/meh but do feel a little uncomfortable after like 2 or 3 hrs, and not much ventilation so It might a get a little hot during the summers3. Mic - The mic is also pretty good, it does a poor job filtering surrounding noise, you wouldn't be able to hear the noise but it lowers your sound4. Sound Quality - I'm not an audiphile but the sound is also good, not too high of a bass but it gets pretty loud without bleeding5. Latency - There isn't much latency or any latency at all that I noticed while daily use, ie on YouTube, media play etc, but there is a significant lag when gaming SO DON'T BUY THIS FOR GAMING6. Connectivity- Connectivity is also ok but not too great, sometimes the connection does breaks and after 5,6 seconds it reconnects automatically, it doesn't happen too often but it does happen usually after long hours of usage7. Battery Life - battery Life is pretty good, I can go 3 days without charging with pretty heavy usage, the battery indication (in the app) is a little off though,meaning it might show 100% within 15-20 mins of charging but the battery drains quickly, you gotta let it charge for an additional 20/30 mins after hitting 100% for the battery to actually be full8.

On the one hand, they excel in terms of features and audio quality, but on the other, their long-term durability is a significant concern when it comes to the wired version.First, let's discuss the positive aspects. The Samsung earphones come packed with features that enhance the listening experience. The sound quality is impressive, delivering crisp and clear audio across a wide range of frequencies. They also offer great noise isolation, which is perfect for shutting out the outside world and immersing yourself in your music or podcasts.The earphones are comfortable to wear for extended periods, and they fit securely in your ears, which is a big plus for active individuals or commuters. The in-line microphone and remote control make it easy to manage calls and playback without reaching for your phone, adding convenience to your daily routine.However, the Achilles' heel of these earphones is their durability, especially when it comes to the wired version. Over time, I found that the wires tend to fray and weaken, leading to audio issues and sometimes complete loss of functionality. It's disappointing to see such a great product compromised by the relatively short lifespan of the wires.If you're considering purchasing these Samsung earphones, I'd strongly recommend the wireless version for better durability. While they come at a higher price point, they eliminate the wire-related durability concerns and provide a more extended period of reliable usage.In conclusion, the Samsung earphones offer excellent audio quality and a range of features that enhance the listening experience.

Right earcup is having very less bass, sent it for warranty claim but they don't cover bass in the warranty.2. Ambient mode is also not working properly in right earcup and they also not solved this issue in warranty claim and rejected my claim.3. I use headphones for work and study but they did not meant for that, even you can't wear them for 1 hour they will cause a lot of pain in your head and around ear.4. ANC is pretty average for this price range, but comfort is  -10/5 Don't trust on YouTube reviews because i trusted on YouTube review and wasted my money.If you are thinking why i have not mentioned about sound quality i think sound quality doesn't matter when comfort is zero.My simple suggestion is if you are planning to buy over ear good ANC headphones save some more money and go for sony you will get good sony headphones under 10,000/-But don't go for this product.Update - They have finally replaced my product after 1.5 months of testing my patience.

The premium material and all as boasted in the review videos, well, a glossy hard plastic doesn't mean it's premium.However, I would give it to the hard plastic it used, the metal hinges and leather cup quality, it sure is durable compared with the other headphones.Sound:I may say it's average or not so good for someone who wants genuine sound. I mean it's too much manipulated for my ears to listen this muffed up sound no matter what mode or settings I play it on.Just annoying it is as it makes no sense of having a 40mm driver to listen the muffed up sound. It may take a while for me to adjust to this sound. An custom app or something could have made it a better experience to get a customized sound profile.Comfort:These are heavy. I don't have any comparison criteria but just 40 mins of wearing these, made my ear heated and sweaty.But didn't caused any pain of any sort which is a good things I guess.The battery and mic quality, well I have a long way to explore that aspect.

It sounds wonderful for both gaming and listening to music. I mostly play Apex, and the distance and accuracy at which I can hear footsteps and gunfire is astonishing. Especially considering what I paid.Now here's the bad part. The original headset I ordered broke after one month of usage. See pic. The cord ripped apart from where the buttons are. What happened is that the material of this cord is EXTREMELY prone to twisting. I noticed this becoming a problem after only a week of usage and I had kept smoothing the cord out to remove the little curls that it forms, because obviously you don't want those to form because it will damage internal wiring etc. So the cord wripped out after I had tried doing this for the umpteenth time. Amazon replaced it for me thankfully, but now I know that I need to find some magical solution from keeping the cord from curling up all over the place, as the curls are extremely stiff.All in all, if you can find a way to avoid this then this headset is an absolute bang for your buck. Once again, the sound quality is fantastic. The comfort is as well. I was really surprised when I realized I had been playing with it on for three hours one day, and not had a headache.\nRead more", '\nHo preso queste cuffie come prova e devo dire che sono stato molto sorpreso, diciamo che queste cuffie sono uguali come il detto "L\'abito non fa il monaco".Perchè dico così? Perchè i materiali non sono eccellenti, la plastica è lucida e si sente che è una plasticaccia che potrebbe o rompersi oppure rigarsi ma non spezzarsi mai, l\'imbottitura è buona ed è anche confortevole ma poi incominciano ad essere fastidiose dopo 5-6 ore di utilizzo continuo.L\'audio è bilanciato, cristallino e godibile sia sui videogiochi che sulle canzoni, ma gli manca il 7.1.Il Microfono è flessibile per avvicinarlo alla vostra bocca e l\'audio non è da microfoni da studio ma è molto pulito, udibile, meglio cuffie da 100 o 200 euro, la pecca sta che non riduce i rumori di fondo, quindi ogni rumore che emetterete il microfono lo capterà senza distinzioni.Io gli do 5 stelle e ve le consiglio perchè come prime cuffie gaming ha dei pregi e piccoli difetti che se riuscite a comprare a 26 euro, il loro prezzo si alza e si abbassa molto spesso, fate un\'ottimo acquisto secondo me.\nRead more', "\nIt's a great gaming headset. It fits loose on your head, but firmly. I wear glasses, and play a lot of games, so this is important to me because a lot of headsets push my glasses against my head and after awhile it can really hurt. It has a sound control panel on the chord. While this can be useful, it is the worst part about the headset in my opinion, because often times I will accidentally press the buttons with my arm while moving because the panel is way too high up on the chord, and the buttons are very easily pressed.Other than that, the sound quality is fantastic, the mic works great, and it's reasonably priced. After my last headset that I had for years broke suddenly, I wasn't sure that I'd be able to find another one as good as it for the same price I got that one for, as it was discontinued over the years. This was cheaper, and I like it way more.

The reviews are very polarising (either good or bad) and to my surprise neither were truly wrong. So i was skeptical but i found it on sale for 999 so i just bought it.. I will do a pros and cons first and a super detailed review after it (the review will be given keeping the price range of 1500-2000 in mind)Pros:- Build Quality- Sound Quality (after EQ) [Amazing Bass, crystal clear and lively vocals with ear-fatigue free & nice treble tones]- Battery Life- Dual Connectivity and stable connection- No noticeable latency in videos- Comfort- Sick RGBCons:- Mic Quality-Sound Quality (without EQ) [Amazing Bass, Bad vocals, Bad treble tones]-Low battery indications every 60 secs after 20% (didn't say 1 min as people might take it as an exaggeration)- You cant change or keep 1 colour on rgb, it changes on its own- Few Service Centres- Sometimes the headphones goes into a weird state where you have to keep the power button pressed for 10-30 seconds for it to work againMinor cons (which are completely fine for the price but are worth mentioning)-the rgb also turns on each time you power on the headphone so turning it off for more battery gets a bit annoying-The earcups dont fold (if you want to keep them on your neck then you will have to extend them , after that they wont restrict your head movement)-Each time you start/turn off the headphones or it connects/disconnects there is a voice announcement which i found to be quite annoyingDETAILED REVIEW1) Build Quality: The headband is made of made up of metal and looks very sturdy. The plastic used on the earcups is also of a good quality and i don't think it will break easily. The wire that is visible is thick and i aint worried about it. The earcups dont fold (which i knew) but it could have been a good addition.  The cushioning on the headband is minimal but soft so you wont have a problem there. The ear cushions are very soft. Dimensions of entire ear cushion 10cm x 8cm . Dimensions of the opening for our ears 5.6cm x 4cm.The buttons wobble a little bit in their place but are clicky & tactile. The box it comes in, is very Sturdy and can be used to keep the headphone.2) Looks: The headphone has a sick matte black colour which i love, the side profile looks amazing, it does look a bit bulky and weird when you look at it from the front though.3) Comfort:  I thought the hole should be as big as my ear to be comfortable which was not the case, my ear is like 6 cm and it still fits inside (with unnoticeable bending as the hole does get a bit bigger inside due to the pressure of our earlobes against it). The headphone does not feel heavy at all. The clamping force is just enough to keep the headphone from slipping, it isn't much which increases the comfort. The earcup wobbles a bit for a comfortable angle on your head. The clicks to increase or decrease the size are tight so the size wont change when you shake your head. I didn't have any discomfort wearing it for 4-5 hours straight. Although, the ears do sweat after 2-3 hours in normal temperature so you have to take a break of 2 mins (it doesnt feel warm but the sweat can speed up the wear and tear of the ear cushions. the way i do it is to just let out the air inside the headphones every once in like 30 mins for 15 secs which is much more efficient)Note: If its your first time wearing an over ear headphone then it might take a couple of days to get used to the weight and clamping force. Also, like all over ear headphones, they will be tight out of the box but they will loosen up after several hours of use (you can just put it on a pillow in between the earcushions instead if your head overnight)4) Battery Life: I think it goes upto 20-22 hours on higher volumes (can be used only till 20% is left, after that unusable due to voice alerts)5) Charging Time: Takes about 1hr 45 mins to go from 20% to 100%6) Connectivity: I tried going into another room and it worked just fine so don't worry about the range. This headphone has dual connectivity which isn't mentioned anywhere, you can connect with 2 devices and if you play something with 1 device, the other pauses and vice versa7) Latency: There is no noticeable latency in most videos or movies (there is a very slight delay which you can notice if you try noticing it hard but you wont do that while watching anything so its safe to say there is no noticeable latency, the latency can also be noticed if the person talks really fast)8) Gaming: When you do gaming via bluetooth you will notice the latency like pretty much every wireless product without a gaming mode of 80ms latency. You can make out where the sound is coming from pretty easily. You can use the aux to get 0 latency.9) Mic: The mic is straight up bad, lacks both clarity and loudness (Do note that the mic won't work with the aux cable)10) Sound Isolation: You can't really hear anything of outside if something is playing in your headphones. If the volume is loud the people around you can hear it which is a con, other headphones do a better job here11) Sound Quality (without EQ): The bass is very powerful, perfect for bass lovers but the mids and highs aren't even good12) Sound Quality (with basic EQ):The Sound is loud enough at 100% for pretty much anyone who does not have significant hearing loss. The bass can be made less powerful or even more powerful if you want to blast your skull with the bass. The mids are produced very nicely. The highs are on point (neither sharp nor dull, its sparky enough without causing ear fatigue). The clarity is also very nice, the sounds seems crystal clear and crispy The distortion is very less.(Note: My Basic EQ is just take the little dots in the right half and increase all of them to some extent, keep the leftmost dot where it was and try to make a straight line between the leftmost and middle dots with the other dots left in the left half). One thing to note is that, you will find that the headphone skipped a word, its random and not that often but its worth mentioning13) Sound quality via aux: The same things apply here but the max volume is 90% of what it was via bluetooth and the clarity gets a boost if you play FLAC format music1 Year Edit for Durability: Everything still stands true, the earcup vinyl (i think that is the material) startedcoming off suddenly after 10 months i think and now its gone but it doesnt make a difference to sound or comfort. It randomly stopped working, i think the power button disconnected so i sent them via courier to the service centre (in warranty) and they sent it back in a week i think. I dropped them twice from 3 feet and it stayed fine, but someone sat on my headphones and one side got de-attached from the headband held on just by wire, it then dropped twice after that and that one side stopped working. I tried contacting service centres about how much the repair will cost so that i dont end up spending 400 or something to get this headphone repaired when i bought it for 999 but they didnt respond so i can spend either 100 to get this to the service centre by courier (most companies have a pick up service like soundcore) or go 20km away to get it repaired myself (which is hard during covid).

It is quiet big like having two black and glowing eggs attached to ears but its worth cause the big egg things has lot of BASS inside LOL.The battery life is incredible, I have been using it since yesterday and it still have 50% battery left.ONLY PROBLEM is that I found the audio has sharp voice somewhat maximised to keep up with that heavy bass, like when you hear a song you will hear the vocals in sharp voice which is not actually pleasant. I counter this problem by using an equilizer in phone and laptop by decreasing the 14 KHz to some level and increasing 910 Hz to some level. And it only happens in bluetooth mode, The aux is perfect though.Apart from all this I love my new headphone, Zebronics done a fabulous job by making it and selling it in such an affordable price.\nRead more']}{'title': '        boAt Rockerz 551ANC Hybrid Active Noise Cancellation Headphones with Up to 100H Playtime, ASAP™ Charge, Ambient Sound Mode &Dual EQ Modes, ENx™ Technology(Stellar Black)       ', 'reviews': ["\nThese (Rockerz ANC 551) headphones are for this price segment.

In winter it will not get sweat around ear but in summers definitely, but it's sort of waterproof didn't absorb the sweat.Battery is definitely long lasting (at 50% lasts around 10 days after using for 5 hours daily), volume at 50% is enough for music listening. Music highs & lows are perfectly balanced not too bass (tip: set enhancements when using on laptop/phone), after some custom settings bass feels good. Didn't require ANC much after wearing it, but its good at this price range, also it does feel like there is some vaccum created around ears, wouldn't use for long duration. Mic quality is good with ENX technology, background noises are removed around 80% so worth it.For home theater experience use Windows volume enhancements in headset volume settings, it does work on it, but don't expect much, for this price range already getting a durable and long lasting product.Dual connection works but doesn't switch instantly, it takes around 5-10 sec sometimes to switch to another device. Bluetooth connection is established instantly for now.Overall for price range of 2600 it is worth it.\nRead more", '\nNo active cancellation i think voice cancellation should be better, very delicate product size is perfect in term of fitting, battery is best and vaule for money for sureI personally recommend that noice cancellation would be very less .....\nRead more', '\nGood headphones nice voice but very poor build qality it breaks easily i bought it in October its not even 1 month it breaks\nRead more', "\nSound quality is 8/10.....The bass is good...however, boat can improve it's vocal clarity.....The Design on the Sunburn edition is too awesome  10/10....and lastly the Bluetooth connectivity is meh...like it often disconnects from my phone....\nRead more", "\nCharging,Performance,Fit,Battery life, Ease of use, Bluetooth connectivity...everything was good.Used almost a year and found 2 issues:1.

The build quality is much better than a lot of headphones even more expensive than these. The Sennheiser and Sony headphones in this price range are not even comparable to these. They don't weigh much so they can easily be worn for 7-8 hrs at a go. The only downside to these are glitches in the connectivity which I'm still trying to figure out.

The bass is robust, and the high frequencies, while slightly louder than my preference, still deliver a clear sound. Cymbal sounds are notably prominent, occasionally to the point of being loud. Across various music genres such as Rock, Jazz, Pop, Indian Classical, and Bollywood, the headphones performed admirably, except for rock music, which I found a bit harsh. However, this can be fine-tuned through the SOUNDCORE app, which provides built-in EQ presets and the option to create custom presets. Overall, considering the price point, these headphones offer exceptional audio quality.Design - 4/5The headphones sport an eye-catching design. Their fit and finish are commendable, although the buttons feel a bit clunky. On the other hand, the touch sensor is highly sensitive and responsive. The black and gold combination, especially the logo, exudes a premium aesthetic.Comfort - 4/5In terms of comfort, these headphones shine. You can wear them all day without any discomfort. The memory foam cushions are thick and plush, providing a comfortable experience for extended use.Battery - 4/5The battery life is excellent. Out of the box, the battery had a decent charge and lasted for more than 15 hours. A full charge is expected to yield an impressive 35-40 hours with ANC (Active Noise Cancellation) activated.Features - 3.5/5ANC performs adequately, effectively reducing external noise, but it falls short of greatness. Call quality was initially subpar, with low volume, which improved after charging and resetting the headphones. Bluetooth connectivity is swift, thanks to the fast-connect feature, ensuring a seamless connection as soon as Bluetooth is activated.VerdictIn conclusion, these headphones are a compelling choice at their price point. While they have a few minor quirks, their impressive audio quality, comfortable design, and long-lasting battery life make them a must-have. I highly recommend giving them a try!\nRead more', "\nGreat product!!All the features that you get in this price is hard to get in the products double its price.

Una maravilla. Aguantan muchísimo. Usándolos casi toda la tarde y parte de la mañana solamente los cargo 1 vez a la semana. Además, cargan rápido.- Comodidad. Otra maravilla. Las orejas no duelen porque quedan completamente cubiertas, y la diadema es más ancha que las habituales, así que no presiona tanto sobre la parte superior del cráneo, que a veces molesta también con otros cascos cuando llevas unas cuantas horas usándolos.- Cancelación de ruido. Es bastante bastante buena. Cancela mejor los sonidos agudos y medios que los graves, pero aún así hace un muy buen trabajo con los graves. En mi caso, muy aprovechados para poder estudiar cuando hay obras, vecinos molestos que no se callan, mi hermano que es flautista. Para poder darme un paseo completamente aislado. Y el resultado es muy muy bueno. Te quitan aproximadamente un 70 - 80 % del ruido ambiental. Y si les subes el volumen un poco, lo eliminas por completo.Son el punto fuerte de estos cascos. Yo la tengo siempre activa la cancelación de ruido (ANC). El modo normal consume algo menos de batería, pero ¿para qué te vas a comprar unos cascos con cancelación de ruido si luego no la usas?- Calidad del sonido. Si le he puesto un 4 en vez de 5 cinco a este apartado de la valoración es porque el usuario tiene que manipular un poco el producto. Me explico.Para poner a funcionar los cascos debes descargar la app de Soundcore. La configuración predeterminada es bastante mala y el sonido es pobre, por no decir otra cosa. Lo bueno es que la misma app tiene un ecualizador que te permite solucionar este problema.Basta ir a la personalización del ecualizador y darle al + (Crear perfil EQ).He probado las 10 configuraciones que hay por ahí rulando en la web (las subo todas al final del comentario por si alguien quiere probarlas) y como conclusión extraigo las siguientes 2 configuraciones:Iluminar-3.5 / 4 / 6 / 6 / 4.5 / 5 / 6 / 6Oscurecer-3.5 / 6 / 2. 5 / 3.5 / 2.5 / 6 / 6 / 4.5El perfil "Iluminar" es todoterreno. Lo puedes poner por defecto y funciona bien con casi cualquier tipo de canción. Si alguna canción te resulta muy estridente (porque de base ya tiene muchos agudos esa canción), puedes seleccionar el modo "Oscurecer", que las suaviza un poco.¿Cómo saber cuándo un medidor se encuentra en el punto 2.5 o -3.5 etc?El cursor de cada frecuencia funciona por redondeo, es decir, para seleccionar 2.5, empezamos a subir el cursor desde el 0. Conforme suba, marcará 1, luego 2 y así sucesivamente. ¿Cuándo paramos? En el punto exacto en el que pasa de 2 a 3, ese punto es 2.5Conforme subes el cursor, lo que hace es ir tomando valores 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4 (para todos estos valores, mostrará que vale 2) Como funciona por redondeo, cuando llega a 2.5 aparece el 3.De igual forma, si queremos el -3.5, vamos bajando desde el -3 y el primer punto en el que aparezca -4 será el -3.5De hecho es más fácil establecer una frecuencia en 2.5 que en 2. Para alcanzar un 2, será más o menos la mitad entre 2.5 y 3.5 o, simplemente, un poquillo más arriba que el 1.5Por si a alguien no le convencen esas configuraciones, aquí hay una recopilación de las configuraciones que hay rulando por ahí en foros, vídeos y demás. Aunque ya digo que después de mucho testear, me quedo con las dos que he puesto arriba (que son producto de modificar y juguetear con algunas de las de aquí abajo)1 / 3 / 2.5 / 2.5 / 3 / 3.5 / 2 / 2.5-6 / 4 / 4.5 / 4 / 2.5 / 6 / 2.5 / 2.5-3 / -2.5 / 3 / 3.5 / 4.5 / -2-6 / 6 / 2.5 / 2.5 / 1.5 / 3.5 / 0 / -2.5-4 / 3.5 / 6 / 6 / 4.5 / 5 / 4 / 6-6 / -1 / 2 / 0 / 1 / 3.5 / -1 / 0-3 / 2 / 4 / 5 / 5 / 4 / -3 / 0-5.5 / 3 / -1.5 / 5.5 / -2 / 3.5 / 4 / -6-1.5 / 4 / 3 / 3 / 2.5 / 4 / 4 / 4-5.5 / 3.5 / -1.5 / 5.5 / -2 / 3.5 / 2 / 0\nRead more', '\nMinha análise abaixo, O HYPE É REAL!Qualidade sonora:(NOTA 9.9)Vou explicar por que não é 10. Não é 10 por que o equalizador stock (padrão) que já vem no fone não é muito bom na minha opinião, pois destaca somente frequências graves e subgraves e anula todas as outras. Mas é possível corrigir isso pelo o aplicativo da soundcore, equalizando do seu jeito, pois com o uso do aplicativo isso é possível, outra razão é que em algumas músicas seu agudo fica bem forte ao ponto de incomodar, mas de toda maneira, também é possível regular isso por meio do equalizador. Gostei muito da qualidade sonora! graves, médios e agudos impecáveis! com destaque para os subgraves! (ATENÇÃO: Você só terá essa qualidade sonora com o ANC desativado)Modo de transparência(10):Amei esse modo, super útil e funciona muito bem, capta bem os sons externos, uso bastante para não ter que tirar o fone da cabeça, além de que é bem fácil ativá-lo e rápido, já que só basta tocar a concha direita do fone por 1s e já altera para o modo transparência.Duração da Bateria(10):Incrível! Dura bastante, serve bem para todo tipo de uso! bateria perfeita, não há reclamações quanto a isso.Design(8,5): Muito lindo, robusto, design mais minimalista e quase tudo de plástico, (com exceção do arco de metal) que mesmo sendo de plástico, ainda assim consegue dar um ar de fone Premium, realmente. Contudo, vi análises na internet que esse fone não é muito resistente quanto parece, de acordo com que ouvi falar, os fones em suas dobradiças depois de um médio tempo de uso começam a se quebrar, porém, vi uma maneira de resolver isso, e é simples, como vocês podem ver na foto, o fone acompanha uma case onde ele sempre está dobrado e encolhido, o que pode com médio prazo forçar as dobradiças do fone ao ponto de racharem e talvez quebrarem, por isso, eu sei que é um acessório, mas recomendo não guardar o fone sempre a case ou evitar dobra-lo muitas vezes, por que isso pode forçar e fazer ele quebrar as dobradiças. Por isso, cuidado, mas se você tiver zelo vale a pena pagar o preço por este fone, porque ele é muito incrível em som e em design, e é resistente o suficiente, só lembre-se de não forçar as dobradiças. Um adendo é que esse fone atrai marcas de dedo.Conchas de couro sintético(9,0):São muito confortáveis, dão um isolamento passivo já bastante suficiente para se isolar um pouco do mundo, enfim não tenho muito o que falar, elas realmente cobriram toda minha orelha com folga (tenho orelha pequena, contudo acho que ficará tudo bem se tiver orelhas maiores) e são bastante confortáveis e macias, muito boas mesmo, porém, infelizmente possuem problemas também, Por ser couro sintético, se o usuário não ter zelo, em menos de um ano já podem apresentar descascamento e aí seria necessário trocar, porém outros fones concorrentestambém apresentam esse problema, então não há como fugir disso, mas ainda assim, apresenta uma boa qualidade, muito boas mesmo.ANC(Cancelamento de ruídos)(7.0)Não gostei muito, é Ok, mas longe de ser ruim hein?, serve para alguns momentos como para assistir vídeos ou só se vc quiser se isolar mesmo, ele funciona e realmente te isola do ambiente, e vai atender a maioria dos usuários. Contudo, ao ouvir músicas com frequências mais graves, não gostei de uma caracterisica que o fone apresentou, pois pude notar que frequências mais agudas e graves ficam  mais apagadas, apesar que a qualidade ainda se mantém muito boa,  isso ainda dá uma certa aparência de som menos encorpado.  Além disso, ao aumentar o volume perto do máximo ou no máximo, nota-se que o fone na tentativa de entregar graves, acaba por entregar um grave muito punch (Soco), e ainda mais é um punch distorcido e que me incomodou e por isso evito de usar o noise cancelling quando estou ouvindo música. No geral não gostei muito, mas era o esperado pela faixa de preço e sim, pelo o preço funciona muito bem, e se você gosta de ASMR esse fone é perfeito para tal, ou de estudar ou apenas se desligar mais do mundo.Aperto na cabeça (10)Ele não aperta muito na cabeça, somente o suficiente para o fone se manter preso na cabeça, e isso é fantástico! (na minha opinião) ele é diferente de outros fones concorrentes. É necessário um grande esforço para que ele caia de sua cabeça, então realmente muito bom!Adendos:1.O fone treme na cabeça, se você não gosta disso, talvez não queira este fone, (mas é normal para fones desse tamanho isso ocorrer), porém em minha experiência achei isso muito bom, dá uma maior imersão no áudio.2.Sobre o áudio p2 é bom mas fica com volume ligeiramente inferior ao bluetooth. E infelizmente as funções no modo P2 de noise cancelling, equalizador, dentre outros ficam indisponíveis, uma vez que o fone fica totalmente desligado quando isto é usado.3.Para realizar chamadas eu gostei bastante do áudio, bem alto e de boa definição, sendo bem bom para realizar reuniões no zoom, meet e dentre outros programas.4.Os Codecs desse fone são: SBC, AAC + HD AUDIO, o que é muito bom, pois vários fones adotam o SBC, que só entrega uma qualidade mediana, mas que também não é ruim. Já o ACC é utilizado em Iphones por exemplo e funciona muito bem por aqui, a qualidade é superior de áudio, e por incrível que pareça para jogos funciona muito bem, o seu delay em minha experiência foi até que melhor que o esperado, mas, pode ser ruim para alguns usuários, pois esse fone não oferece nenhuma função de diminuição de Delay para jogos, pois ele não foi feito para esse público.4.O bluetooth adotado aqui é 5.0, muito bom e com boa estabilidade, não tive problemas5. Seus botões são muito bons, rapidamente você é capaz de se acostumar, e funcionam bem para as funções que lhe foram designadas.6. Em relação ao atendimento ao cliente da OCTO SHOP BR, amei muito, pois todas minhas dúvidas foram respondidas rapidamente e eles procuraram me ajudar o máximo possível! muito obrigado pelo o incrível atendimento, e em relação aos correios, vai depender da sua sorte, mas comigo veio antes do prazo e tudo certinho, sem a caixa estar amassada nem nada, além de que não há necessidade de se preucupar com taxação, já que a própria loja já cuida disso.Resumo: Enfim, recomendo este fone sim com toda certeza de olhos fechados, tem seus problemas como qualquer coisa na vida, mas é muito bom mesmo, mais do que recomendado, O HYPE É REAL!É isso espero ter ajudado alguém a comprar ou a não comprar este fone.\nRead more', '\nEs difícil encontrar un auricular hoy día la verdad. Mil reviews (muchas de ellas pagadas con el producto gratis), y mil modelos tanto de bluetooth como de cable.En el audio el más dinero suele ir relacionado con el mejor calidad. Por eso si no podemos en ese momento o no nos apetece comprar algo demasiado caro, la amplitud de modelos a elegir no se reduce.Esta reseña parte de la base de que un auricular bluetooth jamás nos dará la calidad de audio de uno con cable por muy bueno o avanzado que sea el codec que utilice. En base a eso, en Internet hay un modelo en el que la mayoría de los compradores (o reseñadores de pago) están de acuerdo, Soundcore Life Q30.Después de la tralla que os he dado, al turrón, puntualizaré lo que quiero destacar:- Audio, graves, muchísimos graves. Olvidaos de la respuesta plana (cosa que yo prefiero y me encanta) o de predominancia de agudos. Soundcore le da mucha presencia de graves a este modelo sea el perfil que sea el que elijamos en la ecualización. Por supuesto indagando un poco por la red encontraremos la ecualización perfecta para obtener un sonido HiFi (con las diferencia existentes al no tener codec LDAC el cual sólo está en su hermano mayor de 100€, el Q35). La pongo al final de la reseña. Es por ello que evitad los comentarios en los que ponen pegas al producto por su graves. Se pueden reducir muchísimo y una de las gracias que tiene el producto es la personalización en su sonido. ¿Y por qué me quedo con el modelo si hay que afinar tanto la ecualización? Seguid leyendo.- Ecualizador, como comenté antes, gracias a él mismo podemos aumentar agudos, hacer más plano el sonido, potenciar graves (más aún de como vienen de fábrica), etc, una virguería.- Cancelación de sonido. Las cosas claras, no son los Sony XM3 o XM4, que no os engañen, pero por 59.95€ no existe nada igual en el mercado. El ANC funciona sorprendentemente bien y con gran calidad respecto al audio, por lo que no lo empeora.- Comodidad, todos los auriculares de diadema meten calor en la orejas, ya sea por la piel sintética o por la tela si es el caso. En verano todos nos dará calor, en invierno lógicamente menos. Una vez obviado esto las espumas parecen foam blandito que se adaptan a la cabeza super bien y no te enteras apenas que los llevas puesto, un 10 por el fabricante la verdad.- Bolsa de almacenaje, aquí no me ha gustado nada lo que ha hecho Soundcore. En las reviews del producto venía una bolsa distinta a la que están dando ahora. Antes tenía la forma de los auriculares en una especie de foam y con un bolsillo para los cables, ahora (ved foto adjunta) no es así y no hay bolsillo para los cables sino un bolsito que se cierra. Muy mal, de hecho les he escrito para comentarles el detalle, a ver qué me dicen.- Cable, el audio por cable es normalito, no son unos Audio Technica ni unos Beyerdynamics, da tanta calidad como por bluetooth pero sólo ellos lo saben, en la última actualización 2.30 se han cargado el ANC con la conexión cableada. Espero que lo solucionen.En resumen, no hay nada mejor por 60 euros, así de simple. Puedes probar 100 marcas, pero es que ni los Sony bluetooth de 30/50 euros se acercan a la personalización de sonido o al ANC que tienen los Q30. Reconozco que me desencanté mucho al ponerlos en funcionamiento y ver tantos graves, pero cuando consigues ecualizarlos, son una delicia. Y si a alguien le cabe duda, SÍ, el auricular lo compré de mi bolsillo 100%.NOTA: La ecualización la podéis poner así = -6, +5, +4, +2, +2, +6, 0, +1\nRead more', '\nBuena calidad de construcción, almohadillas cómodas pero de espuma de poca densidad lo que repercute en un aislamiento pasivo del ruido mejorable. La diadema és ancha, yo tengo un cabezón y no me aprieta nada, preferiría que el ajuste fuera más firme, aunque va a gustos.La aplicación muy bien, permite actualizar firmware, elegir ecualizador, crear uno a tu gusto y está la función de escuchar sonidos relajantes de la naturaleza, con o son anc, muy buena idea.El sonido és bueno por el precio, con cuerpo. Tienes muchas opciones de ecualización pre-fijadas si bien yo funciono con las que he creado yo, a mi gusto. Recomiendo ésta última opción para tener un sonido adaptado a tu gusto.Respecto a la cancelación de sonido, decir 2 cosas.La 1a que és flojilla, no cancela mucho aunque de notarse se nota,pero poca cosa, no entiendo las muchas reviews que dicen que es tan buena... claro que por el precio no podemos ir de tiquis-miquis.La 2a cosa y , lo que más me ha decepcionado de este auricular, és que el sonido con el anc conectado és malo. El campo se estrecha un mundo, suena como si escucharas a través de un tubo, el sonido se transforma a peor por lo que mejor escucharlo con el anc desconectado, mucho mejor.Me daré unos dias más para darle rodaje y ver que tal, si no mejoran los devolveré. No tiene sentido que unos auriculares con anc y buen sonido, se vuelvan malos una vez conectas el anc.Addenda1.Después de 2 dias de uso intensivo puedo matizar el problema con el anc. Hay un problema de software , que no sé si afecta a todos, o a un lote de auriculares en particular, ya que he visto reviews de otros usuarios que les sucede lo mismo. El tema es que cuando cambias entre los modos anc de ‘interior’ _‘exterior’ se escucha el sonido mal, como a lata. Por ejemplo,  si estás en el modo ‘interior’ de la anc y pasas a ‘exterior’ el sonido se vuelve pésimo,  O al activar la anc desde el modo normal que suena a lata. O si estás en anc i la quitas volviendo al modo normal, se escucha a lata unos segundos y luego por sí solo y sin tocar nada vuelve a oirse bien.En resumen, hay fallos de sonido en la transición entre modos anc i al activar el anc. Espero lo solucionen en la próxima actualización de firmware, sinó los devolveré.Addenda 2Después de contactar con el servicio técnico y decirme que pruebe a reiniciar los auriculares o que lo vincule a otro móvil, me sigue pasando el mismo error. Devueltos.Addenda 3Después de lo sucedido, el servicio técnico me envió otro auricular de prueba pudiendo verificar que los anteriores me vinieron defectuosos. Ahora se escuchan estupendamente (por el precio) y no dan ningún tipo de problema cuando cambio entre tipos de cancelación de ruido. Gracias por la excelencia del servicio post-venta, un 10. Ahora sí puedo recomendarlos honestamente.\nRead more', "\nImballo e tempi di spedizione come tradizione Amazon. Le mie cuffie ordinate la sera sono arrivate la mattina del giorno dopo. Esperienza d'uso completamente soddisfatto. Funzionalità, occorre fare lamano ai tasti che sono piccoli ma ben disposti, solidi e con un feedback tattile ottimo. Comprate ad occhi shiusi, rapporto qualità/prezzo/prestazioni senza eguali.Se volete leggere nello specifico prestazioni, dati tecnici e consigli di uso, proseguite.La scatola di imballo, contiene una custodia semi-rigida in tessuto mesh del peso di gr 422 (cuffie ed accessori) con chiusura a zip con cuciture ricoperte da una fettuccia, una targhetta cucita sul bordo interno, con stilizzate le cuffie, indica in che posizione vanno rimesse a posto. Esternamente è cucina una cinghia ad anello per il trasporto (quindi non il solito sacchetto morbido in vellutino).All’interno della custodia sono presenti le cuffie gr 267 (fate una foto per capire come vanno rimesse a posto – oppure vedi foto allegata alla recensione, ovvero, l’archetto va appoggiato sul supporto in gomma presente nella custodia e non all’interno di esso). In un sacchettino di velluto, sono presenti cavo di ricarica di 60 cm da USB ad USB – C (senza spina che va comprata a parte oppure usate quella del vostro cellulare o tablet) ed cavo audio cm 128 con il jack da 3,5 mm per il collegamento senza bluetooth ad una entrata audio.L’archetto regolabile con scatti precisi, è in metallo e ben imbottito nella parte che poggia sulla testa. I padiglioni, con driver da 40 cm, sono di un materiale in simil-pelle traspirante e molto morbido, che poggia sulla testa circondando il padiglione, creando un effetto “ventosa” leggero e piacevole ed isolando in parte, meccanicamente, dai rumori esterni. Le cuffie sono stabili muovendo la testa e la regolazione dell’archetto è stabile.PADIGLIONE SINISTRO: sono presenti la presa USB – C per la ricarica, vicino al bottone di accensione (premere per accendere, tenere premuto per spegnere fino alla accensione di un led rosso) che serve anche per l’accoppiamento Bluetooth, tenere premuto qualche secondo, fino alla accensione di un led blu e bianco alternati, che avvisano della ricerca di dispositivi bluetooth nelle vicinanze, quando la luce blu sola lampeggia, indica che l’accoppiamento è eseguito con successo, ed il tasto per la funzione di “Cancellazione del Rumore” in tre modalità:TOTALE: tutti i rumori vengono cancellati.TRASPARENZA: si sentono i rumori esterni “captati” dai 4 microfoni presenti sulle cuffie, utile per sentire una persona che ci parla o mentre si passeggia per sentire le macchine.SPENTO: cancellazione passiva, ovvero i rumori si sentono volume ed udito permettendo.Poggiando un dispositivo NFC sulla parte esterna del padiglione sinistro, è possibile fare l’accoppiamento istantaneo senza usare la ricerca con il bluetooth.Ogni volta che viene premuto il tasto “CN” una voce in cuffia ci avvisa della modalità attivata.PADIGLIONE DESTRO: ci sono i bottoni del Volume Su e Volume Giù (per riconoscerlo ha un pallino in rilievo) che se premuti in maniera prolungata cambiano traccia andando avanti o indietro nell’elenco delle tracce, un terzo bottone con funzione Play/Pausa, se premuto in maniera prolungata, attiva l’Assistente Vocale, veramente funzionante. Infine vi è l’entrata per il cavo audio.Pigiando qualche secondo, sulla parte esterna del padiglione si attiva la funzione “Trasparenza” (ovvero, i microfoni della cuffia fanno sentire i rumori ambientali che ci circondano in cuffia), pigiando di nuovo si disattiva tornando alla impostazione precedentemente impostata. Una voce nella cuffia ci avvisa della modalità “Trasparenza Disattivata/Attivata”.Il tutto è accompagnato dalla applicazione “Soundcore Life Q30” scaricabile sul sito del produttore, per Android ed Apple.La applicazione permette di:- Equalizzare le cuffie con 22 Preset non sovra-scrivibili, ma modificabili e salvabili con altro nome, quindi in tutto 44 equalizzazioni possibili.- Funzione “Qualità del Sonno” con 11 suoni ambientali (pioggia, vento, suoni della montagna, etc) sovrapponibili ed equalizzabili nella loro sovrapposizione, ovvero un suono più forte e l’altro più delicato, con timer ed auto-spegnimento completamente personalizzabili. Utile per esempio quando ci si deve concentrare o quando ci si vuole rilassare per studiare o per leggere un bel libro.- “Rumore Bianco” sono dei preset di suoni creati da voi o dalla Comunity, eh già, perché con l’app ci si può collegare anche ad una comunity di persone che usano i prodotti Anker, (cuffie ed altro) con un forum dedicato per chiedere consigli.ATTENZIONE: se le cuffie vengono collegate con il cavo ad una fonte audio, il bluetooth si disattiva e la applicazione “Soundcore Life Q30” non può essere usata cosi come tutte le impostazioni dell’equalizzatore delle cuffie, dovrete quindi usare l’equalizzatore della periferica alla quale siete collegati tramite cavo ed il microfono della periferica alla quale siete collegati tramite cavo audio, per parlare.Le cuffie sono dotate di protocollo bluetooth 5 quindi, possono essere collegate contemporaneamente a due periferiche differenti contemporaneamente, posto che entrambe abbiano il bluetooth 5, ed ovviamente funzionerà una periferica alla volta. Quindi potete vedere un film sul pc e tenere collegato il cellulare e con le cuffie ascoltare e parlare nel caso di chiamata in arrivo sul cellulare.Nel caso l’accoppiamento con una periferica non funzionasse, tenete premuto il tasto di accensione e il tasto di Volume Su per resettarle fino a quando il led lampeggia ripetutamente rosso e blu. Non occorrerà rifare l’accoppiamento in altre periferiche già accoppiate, si resettano solo le cuffie.DATI TECNICI:- Silk Diaphragm Drivers da 40mm certificati Hi-Res Audio. Questo significa che le cuffie possono riprodurre l'intero spettro dell'Audio Hi-Res (assumendo che il file musicale che state ascoltando sia anch'esso Hi-Res), ovvero, superano le specifiche dei CD audio, e cioè 16 bit di profondità e 44,1 kHz di frequenza di campionamento.In genere l'orecchio umano può udire i suoni nell'intervallo di frequenza che va dai 20 Hz ai 20000 Hz, anche se molti adulti non sono in grado di sentire sopra i 16000 Hz avere un range più elevato  16Hz – 40kHz consiste in una qualità sonora veramente elevata, equiparabile solo con cuffie di ben altra fascia di prezzo.- Impedenza 16 Ω . Se collegate tramite cavo, la resa in frequenza, sarà più elevata rispetto a cuffie con impedenza maggiore, ad esempio 32 Ω come la maggior parte delle cuffie da studio. In parole semplici, se le cuffie le userete collegate tramite cavo audio con telefono e/o tablet quanto più l’impedenza è minore tanto meno sarà la corrente richiesta per funzionare e quindi necessiterete di meno volume per sentire le cuffie. Quindi con periferiche come cellulari e tablet il volume di ascolto sarà maggiore in quanto le cuffie necessiteranno di meno alimentazione.- Bluetooth 5.0 (range di 15 metri) quindi possibilità di connessione con due dispositivi contemporaneamente.- Digital Hybrid ANC, Multi-mode Noise Cancellation.- Possibilità di aggiornare il firmware delle cuffie se disponibile tramite la applicazione Soundcore.- Funzione Transparency, ovvero i microfoni sui padiglioni riproducono in cuffia i rumori ambientali sovrapposti alla sorgente audio che stiamo ascoltando.- supporto all’NFC, possibilità di accoppiare le cuffie a dispositivi provvisti di NFC. Non è possibile fare l’accoppiamento con NFC se le cuffie sono collegate tramite cavo.- 2 microfoni per le chiamate.- porta USB Type-C per la ricarica, che avviene in circa 2 ore,  ATTENZIONE quando sono in carica le cuffie non si possono usare neanche con il cavo. Per usarle con il  cavo occorre un minimo di ricarica, considerando che supporta la RICARICA VELOCE in solo 5 minuti di carica 4 ore di utilizzo, il problema non si pone.- batteria 720 mAh. 40 ore di riproduzione musicale con ANC attivato (60 ore con ANC disattivato).- Audio codec supportati SBC, AAC, i codec aptX non sono supportati quindi niente audio Flac, dovrete rivolgervi al modello superiore le Q35 ma ad altri costi.ATTENZIONESe utilizzate le cuffie in bluetooth, su di un pc per ascoltare dei video e contemporaneamente le avete collegate al telefono sempre in bluetooth, per rispondere alle chiamate, disabilitate il microfono del pc, altrimenti interferisce con il microfono delle cuffie ed in chiamata avrete un fastidioso eco di ritorno. Contemporaneamente, abilitate sul pc le cuffie come solo audio (icona delle cuffie senza il microfono) perché le cuffie collegate come “hand set” (icona cuffie con microfono) hanno un suono mono che viene riprodotto uguale in entrambi i padiglioni, quindi niente effetto stereo.Se usate il pc sia per video-chiamate ed fruizione video e musica e siete collegati anche con il telefono (a meno di non convivere con il ritorno eco in cuffia), abilitate nella scheda audio del pc le cuffie come periferica audio e voce, (icona con le cuffie e microfono) ed anche come periferica audio e disabilitate il microfono del pc. Al contempo abilitate le cuffie sul telefono come auricolare, non come “handset”. Potrete ascoltare sul pc la musica o i video in stereo e parlare tramite le cuffie quando riceverete una telefonata video sul pc e potrete rispondere ad una chiamata sul cellulare ascoltando la chiamata in cuffia e parlando nel microfono del cellulare.ATTENZIONE:Se collegate le cuffie tramite cavo, potrete collegarvi ad una sola periferica, il bluetooth si spegne e così anche i microfoni delle cuffie, dovrete quindi usare il microfono della periferica alla quale siete collegati tramite cavo.Preferite il cavo se siete amanti del buon suono ma il Bluetooth va più che bene in ogni altro caso.Se avete altri dubbi, sul sito del produttore troverete dei video di istruzioni per ogni funzione delle cuffie ed un forum con una comunity molto vasta per porre qualsiasi quesito attinente alle cuffie.\nRead more"]}{'title': '        HAMMER Bash Max Over The Ear Wireless Bluetooth Headphones with Mic, Touch Control, Deep Bass, Upto 18 Hours Playtime, Bluetooth 5.3, Workout/Travel (Black)       ', 'reviews': ["\nHonestly this headphone is ratio'd by Noise Two in almost every single aspect.And just so you know it doesn't look nearly as good as in photos.Albeit, it's not a bad headphone by any means.Despite Noise Two being better, I'm keeping this one cuz it can swivel.Its also slightly more comfortable than that since it larger ear cups.As far as touch controls are concerned, they aren't faulty or anything, you just have to get used to it.\nRead more", "\nFirst thing about this product is this is very comfortable around your ears and plus this product is worth if you looking for very comfy headphones then should definitely but this and the best part is sound quality of this product is amazing mind-blowing go for it guys and don't worry about battery life it stays till 2-3 days\nRead more", '\nThis products sound quality is really very good.

The built quality is amazing, all around it's plastic with foam on the headband but it's very sturdy, the headband is not too loose, slightly tight but it does loosen up a bit eventually2. Comfort - The ear foams are ok/meh but do feel a little uncomfortable after like 2 or 3 hrs, and not much ventilation so It might a get a little hot during the summers3. Mic - The mic is also pretty good, it does a poor job filtering surrounding noise, you wouldn't be able to hear the noise but it lowers your sound4. Sound Quality - I'm not an audiphile but the sound is also good, not too high of a bass but it gets pretty loud without bleeding5. Latency - There isn't much latency or any latency at all that I noticed while daily use, ie on YouTube, media play etc, but there is a significant lag when gaming SO DON'T BUY THIS FOR GAMING6. Connectivity- Connectivity is also ok but not too great, sometimes the connection does breaks and after 5,6 seconds it reconnects automatically, it doesn't happen too often but it does happen usually after long hours of usage7. Battery Life - battery Life is pretty good, I can go 3 days without charging with pretty heavy usage, the battery indication (in the app) is a little off though,meaning it might show 100% within 15-20 mins of charging but the battery drains quickly, you gotta let it charge for an additional 20/30 mins after hitting 100% for the battery to actually be full8. Range- The range is not bad, nothing crazy, around 5 to 6 meters9. Buttons - 3 okish responsive physical buttons, half to a second delay to pause/play, not much delay for the volume buttons, coulda been more responsive since these are physical buttons but doesn't really matter for the overall experienceAlso this is something for Bluetooth headphones in general(not all of them) to note if you're using a 2.4Ghz wifi on an older mid range/ low end Android phone, when you're on an internet call on your phone (doesn't happen with laptops) the call audio quality and connectivity is fine but the wifi speed drops significantly for any other use other than the call because the Bluetooth frequency is also 2.4Ghz and interferes with the wifi, don't quote me on that (found it on the internet)\nRead more", '\nAmazing experience, sound quality is good not too much, gives comfort you need for ears ️\nRead more', '\nValue for money.

On the one hand, they excel in terms of features and audio quality, but on the other, their long-term durability is a significant concern when it comes to the wired version.First, let's discuss the positive aspects. The Samsung earphones come packed with features that enhance the listening experience. The sound quality is impressive, delivering crisp and clear audio across a wide range of frequencies. They also offer great noise isolation, which is perfect for shutting out the outside world and immersing yourself in your music or podcasts.The earphones are comfortable to wear for extended periods, and they fit securely in your ears, which is a big plus for active individuals or commuters. The in-line microphone and remote control make it easy to manage calls and playback without reaching for your phone, adding convenience to your daily routine.However, the Achilles' heel of these earphones is their durability, especially when it comes to the wired version. Over time, I found that the wires tend to fray and weaken, leading to audio issues and sometimes complete loss of functionality. It's disappointing to see such a great product compromised by the relatively short lifespan of the wires.If you're considering purchasing these Samsung earphones, I'd strongly recommend the wireless version for better durability. While they come at a higher price point, they eliminate the wire-related durability concerns and provide a more extended period of reliable usage.In conclusion, the Samsung earphones offer excellent audio quality and a range of features that enhance the listening experience. However, if you opt for the wired version, be prepared for potential durability issues with the wires over time. For a more lasting and hassle-free experience, the wireless option may be the way to go.\nRead more", '\nValue for money\nRead more', '\nNice\nRead more', '\nVery good product in this price range, good sound, fit for ear comfort.

It sounds wonderful for both gaming and listening to music. I mostly play Apex, and the distance and accuracy at which I can hear footsteps and gunfire is astonishing. Especially considering what I paid.Now here's the bad part. The original headset I ordered broke after one month of usage. See pic. The cord ripped apart from where the buttons are. What happened is that the material of this cord is EXTREMELY prone to twisting. I noticed this becoming a problem after only a week of usage and I had kept smoothing the cord out to remove the little curls that it forms, because obviously you don't want those to form because it will damage internal wiring etc. So the cord wripped out after I had tried doing this for the umpteenth time. Amazon replaced it for me thankfully, but now I know that I need to find some magical solution from keeping the cord from curling up all over the place, as the curls are extremely stiff.All in all, if you can find a way to avoid this then this headset is an absolute bang for your buck.

It fits loose on your head, but firmly. I wear glasses, and play a lot of games, so this is important to me because a lot of headsets push my glasses against my head and after awhile it can really hurt. It has a sound control panel on the chord. While this can be useful, it is the worst part about the headset in my opinion, because often times I will accidentally press the buttons with my arm while moving because the panel is way too high up on the chord, and the buttons are very easily pressed.Other than that, the sound quality is fantastic, the mic works great, and it's reasonably priced.

Let me get this straight.... I havent been using this headset for straight up 4 years... I have tried many a headphones and in-ears after this... But for the first 2 years i had no other choice but to use it..... I still use it every now and again these days.... And that should make my review CLEAR as i will give you all of the the wholistic view of the headphones...(MIDRANGE ONLY-audiophiles dont laugh) (ONLY HEAVY READERS MAY READ THIS WHOLE... BUT I WILL TRY TO MAKE IT AS SHORT AS POSSIBLE)For me i have tried BOAT in-ears which come around 599 or 499, JBL heasets which come around 799....and currently Jabra smart halo which was given to me.... Price is around 5000-7000.... Bluetooth headsetNow starting the review.... You must have read the above review and gotten a general idea of the sound quality and its lightweightedness...OKAY these are REALLY LIGHT and COMFY headsets... It doesnt clamp onto your ears like other on-ear headsets...PORTABILITY is on par.... The build is such that it could be folded and there are no useless curves so you can throw them into your bag and do not worry about it being crushed...The third is the main and its the SOUND QUALITY... damn... I am still shocked till this day... How were they able to pack these sounding drivers in there.... And the fact that it was available to me 4 hears ago... Probably lower than this price... I got it for Rs.499 which is just a total steal..... The sound is kinda FLAT.... And if you are a PROPER LISTENER... this is obviously a PLUS POINT.... It has a SOUND SIGNATURE very pleasing to hear and should not build up TENSION and ADRENALIN in the moments where you just want to.... SLEEP...... or relax.... Also somewhat FLAT signature lets you listen to the song the way it was meant to be BY THE ARTIST...Also the sound is WIDE...It doesnt feel that the sound is only playing inside your head... YEAH it is pretty much the best SOUND STAGE you can get at this priceNow before you get too excited... Let me throw to you some of its defects in sound like a saucy villian MUAHAHAHA.... FIRST is that of its loose fit....yea it fits nicely but after 8 to 10 months these becomes kinda loose... So the volume decreases... Doesnt effect the SOUND QUALITY though....Second is bad... But not for all...it is that it has a LOW VOLUME.... If you want to listen to high volume music.... This headphones doesnt go that far... You may be able to increase it through some apps...but it is not that high from default....Third is the NOISE-CANCELLATION.... These have almost no noise cancellation... So if you are in a loud environment... You may hear the music but only with the rumbles of the real world....(For me it is not a disadvantage as i hate noise cancellation but for many it is so I added)The FOURTH is the REAL DEPTH in sound.... Although the sound is organic... But the depth in the sound is really low.... In ears have a greater depth compared to headphones...IN CONCLUSION.... If your budget is under 700...definately get this one for comfort and relaxation... If you are a ADRENALIN JUNKIE... get an in-ear...those go up monstrous in volumes and bass...Also i think i dont need to write about DURABILTY....its been freaking 4 years and i havent had a single issue of time with this thing....Thats all for now folks...THNX FOR READING....and damn you are a heavy reader....

Right earcup is having very less bass, sent it for warranty claim but they don't cover bass in the warranty.2. Ambient mode is also not working properly in right earcup and they also not solved this issue in warranty claim and rejected my claim.3. I use headphones for work and study but they did not meant for that, even you can't wear them for 1 hour they will cause a lot of pain in your head and around ear.4. ANC is pretty average for this price range, but comfort is  -10/5 Don't trust on YouTube reviews because i trusted on YouTube review and wasted my money.If you are thinking why i have not mentioned about sound quality i think sound quality doesn't matter when comfort is zero.My simple suggestion is if you are planning to buy over ear good ANC headphones save some more money and go for sony you will get good sony headphones under 10,000/-But don't go for this product.Update - They have finally replaced my product after 1.5 months of testing my patience.

I mean it's too much manipulated for my ears to listen this muffed up sound no matter what mode or settings I play it on.Just annoying it is as it makes no sense of having a 40mm driver to listen the muffed up sound. It may take a while for me to adjust to this sound. An custom app or something could have made it a better experience to get a customized sound profile.Comfort:These are heavy. I don't have any comparison criteria but just 40 mins of wearing these, made my ear heated and sweaty.But didn't caused any pain of any sort which is a good things I guess.The battery and mic quality, well I have a long way to explore that aspect.

It sounds wonderful for both gaming and listening to music. I mostly play Apex, and the distance and accuracy at which I can hear footsteps and gunfire is astonishing. Especially considering what I paid.Now here's the bad part. The original headset I ordered broke after one month of usage. See pic. The cord ripped apart from where the buttons are. What happened is that the material of this cord is EXTREMELY prone to twisting. I noticed this becoming a problem after only a week of usage and I had kept smoothing the cord out to remove the little curls that it forms, because obviously you don't want those to form because it will damage internal wiring etc. So the cord wripped out after I had tried doing this for the umpteenth time. Amazon replaced it for me thankfully, but now I know that I need to find some magical solution from keeping the cord from curling up all over the place, as the curls are extremely stiff.All in all, if you can find a way to avoid this then this headset is an absolute bang for your buck. Once again, the sound quality is fantastic. The comfort is as well. I was really surprised when I realized I had been playing with it on for three hours one day, and not had a headache.\nRead more", '\nHo preso queste cuffie come prova e devo dire che sono stato molto sorpreso, diciamo che queste cuffie sono uguali come il detto "L\'abito non fa il monaco".Perchè dico così?

It fits loose on your head, but firmly. I wear glasses, and play a lot of games, so this is important to me because a lot of headsets push my glasses against my head and after awhile it can really hurt. It has a sound control panel on the chord. While this can be useful, it is the worst part about the headset in my opinion, because often times I will accidentally press the buttons with my arm while moving because the panel is way too high up on the chord, and the buttons are very easily pressed.Other than that, the sound quality is fantastic, the mic works great, and it's reasonably priced. After my last headset that I had for years broke suddenly, I wasn't sure that I'd be able to find another one as good as it for the same price I got that one for, as it was discontinued over the years. This was cheaper, and I like it way more.

The reviews are very polarising (either good or bad) and to my surprise neither were truly wrong. So i was skeptical but i found it on sale for 999 so i just bought it.. I will do a pros and cons first and a super detailed review after it (the review will be given keeping the price range of 1500-2000 in mind)Pros:- Build Quality- Sound Quality (after EQ) [Amazing Bass, crystal clear and lively vocals with ear-fatigue free & nice treble tones]- Battery Life- Dual Connectivity and stable connection- No noticeable latency in videos- Comfort- Sick RGBCons:- Mic Quality-Sound Quality (without EQ) [Amazing Bass, Bad vocals, Bad treble tones]-Low battery indications every 60 secs after 20% (didn't say 1 min as people might take it as an exaggeration)- You cant change or keep 1 colour on rgb, it changes on its own- Few Service Centres- Sometimes the headphones goes into a weird state where you have to keep the power button pressed for 10-30 seconds for it to work againMinor cons (which are completely fine for the price but are worth mentioning)-the rgb also turns on each time you power on the headphone so turning it off for more battery gets a bit annoying-The earcups dont fold (if you want to keep them on your neck then you will have to extend them , after that they wont restrict your head movement)-Each time you start/turn off the headphones or it connects/disconnects there is a voice announcement which i found to be quite annoyingDETAILED REVIEW1) Build Quality: The headband is made of made up of metal and looks very sturdy. The plastic used on the earcups is also of a good quality and i don't think it will break easily. The wire that is visible is thick and i aint worried about it. The earcups dont fold (which i knew) but it could have been a good addition.  The cushioning on the headband is minimal but soft so you wont have a problem there. The ear cushions are very soft. Dimensions of entire ear cushion 10cm x 8cm . Dimensions of the opening for our ears 5.6cm x 4cm.The buttons wobble a little bit in their place but are clicky & tactile. The box it comes in, is very Sturdy and can be used to keep the headphone.2) Looks: The headphone has a sick matte black colour which i love, the side profile looks amazing, it does look a bit bulky and weird when you look at it from the front though.3) Comfort:  I thought the hole should be as big as my ear to be comfortable which was not the case, my ear is like 6 cm and it still fits inside (with unnoticeable bending as the hole does get a bit bigger inside due to the pressure of our earlobes against it). The headphone does not feel heavy at all. The clamping force is just enough to keep the headphone from slipping, it isn't much which increases the comfort. The earcup wobbles a bit for a comfortable angle on your head. The clicks to increase or decrease the size are tight so the size wont change when you shake your head. I didn't have any discomfort wearing it for 4-5 hours straight. Although, the ears do sweat after 2-3 hours in normal temperature so you have to take a break of 2 mins (it doesnt feel warm but the sweat can speed up the wear and tear of the ear cushions. the way i do it is to just let out the air inside the headphones every once in like 30 mins for 15 secs which is much more efficient)Note: If its your first time wearing an over ear headphone then it might take a couple of days to get used to the weight and clamping force. Also, like all over ear headphones, they will be tight out of the box but they will loosen up after several hours of use (you can just put it on a pillow in between the earcushions instead if your head overnight)4) Battery Life: I think it goes upto 20-22 hours on higher volumes (can be used only till 20% is left, after that unusable due to voice alerts)5) Charging Time: Takes about 1hr 45 mins to go from 20% to 100%6) Connectivity: I tried going into another room and it worked just fine so don't worry about the range. This headphone has dual connectivity which isn't mentioned anywhere, you can connect with 2 devices and if you play something with 1 device, the other pauses and vice versa7) Latency: There is no noticeable latency in most videos or movies (there is a very slight delay which you can notice if you try noticing it hard but you wont do that while watching anything so its safe to say there is no noticeable latency, the latency can also be noticed if the person talks really fast)8) Gaming: When you do gaming via bluetooth you will notice the latency like pretty much every wireless product without a gaming mode of 80ms latency. You can make out where the sound is coming from pretty easily. You can use the aux to get 0 latency.9) Mic: The mic is straight up bad, lacks both clarity and loudness (Do note that the mic won't work with the aux cable)10) Sound Isolation: You can't really hear anything of outside if something is playing in your headphones. If the volume is loud the people around you can hear it which is a con, other headphones do a better job here11) Sound Quality (without EQ): The bass is very powerful, perfect for bass lovers but the mids and highs aren't even good12) Sound Quality (with basic EQ):The Sound is loud enough at 100% for pretty much anyone who does not have significant hearing loss. The bass can be made less powerful or even more powerful if you want to blast your skull with the bass. The mids are produced very nicely. The highs are on point (neither sharp nor dull, its sparky enough without causing ear fatigue). The clarity is also very nice, the sounds seems crystal clear and crispy The distortion is very less.(Note: My Basic EQ is just take the little dots in the right half and increase all of them to some extent, keep the leftmost dot where it was and try to make a straight line between the leftmost and middle dots with the other dots left in the left half). One thing to note is that, you will find that the headphone skipped a word, its random and not that often but its worth mentioning13) Sound quality via aux: The same things apply here but the max volume is 90% of what it was via bluetooth and the clarity gets a boost if you play FLAC format music1 Year Edit for Durability: Everything still stands true, the earcup vinyl (i think that is the material) startedcoming off suddenly after 10 months i think and now its gone but it doesnt make a difference to sound or comfort. It randomly stopped working, i think the power button disconnected so i sent them via courier to the service centre (in warranty) and they sent it back in a week i think. I dropped them twice from 3 feet and it stayed fine, but someone sat on my headphones and one side got de-attached from the headband held on just by wire, it then dropped twice after that and that one side stopped working. I tried contacting service centres about how much the repair will cost so that i dont end up spending 400 or something to get this headphone repaired when i bought it for 999 but they didnt respond so i can spend either 100 to get this to the service centre by courier (most companies have a pick up service like soundcore) or go 20km away to get it repaired myself (which is hard during covid).

It is quiet big like having two black and glowing eggs attached to ears but its worth cause the big egg things has lot of BASS inside LOL.The battery life is incredible, I have been using it since yesterday and it still have 50% battery left.ONLY PROBLEM is that I found the audio has sharp voice somewhat maximised to keep up with that heavy bass, like when you hear a song you will hear the vocals in sharp voice which is not actually pleasant. I counter this problem by using an equilizer in phone and laptop by decreasing the 14 KHz to some level and increasing 910 Hz to some level. And it only happens in bluetooth mode, The aux is perfect though.Apart from all this I love my new headphone, Zebronics done a fabulous job by making it and selling it in such an affordable price.\nRead more']}{'title': '        boAt Rockerz 551ANC Hybrid Active Noise Cancellation Headphones with Up to 100H Playtime, ASAP™ Charge, Ambient Sound Mode &Dual EQ Modes, ENx™ Technology(Stellar Black)       ', 'reviews': ["\nThese (Rockerz ANC 551) headphones are for this price segment.

The bass is robust, and the high frequencies, while slightly louder than my preference, still deliver a clear sound. Cymbal sounds are notably prominent, occasionally to the point of being loud. Across various music genres such as Rock, Jazz, Pop, Indian Classical, and Bollywood, the headphones performed admirably, except for rock music, which I found a bit harsh. However, this can be fine-tuned through the SOUNDCORE app, which provides built-in EQ presets and the option to create custom presets. Overall, considering the price point, these headphones offer exceptional audio quality.Design - 4/5The headphones sport an eye-catching design. Their fit and finish are commendable, although the buttons feel a bit clunky. On the other hand, the touch sensor is highly sensitive and responsive. The black and gold combination, especially the logo, exudes a premium aesthetic.Comfort - 4/5In terms of comfort, these headphones shine. You can wear them all day without any discomfort. The memory foam cushions are thick and plush, providing a comfortable experience for extended use.Battery - 4/5The battery life is excellent. Out of the box, the battery had a decent charge and lasted for more than 15 hours. A full charge is expected to yield an impressive 35-40 hours with ANC (Active Noise Cancellation) activated.Features - 3.5/5ANC performs adequately, effectively reducing external noise, but it falls short of greatness. Call quality was initially subpar, with low volume, which improved after charging and resetting the headphones. Bluetooth connectivity is swift, thanks to the fast-connect feature, ensuring a seamless connection as soon as Bluetooth is activated.VerdictIn conclusion, these headphones are a compelling choice at their price point.

Una maravilla. Aguantan muchísimo. Usándolos casi toda la tarde y parte de la mañana solamente los cargo 1 vez a la semana. Además, cargan rápido.- Comodidad. Otra maravilla. Las orejas no duelen porque quedan completamente cubiertas, y la diadema es más ancha que las habituales, así que no presiona tanto sobre la parte superior del cráneo, que a veces molesta también con otros cascos cuando llevas unas cuantas horas usándolos.- Cancelación de ruido. Es bastante bastante buena. Cancela mejor los sonidos agudos y medios que los graves, pero aún así hace un muy buen trabajo con los graves. En mi caso, muy aprovechados para poder estudiar cuando hay obras, vecinos molestos que no se callan, mi hermano que es flautista. Para poder darme un paseo completamente aislado. Y el resultado es muy muy bueno. Te quitan aproximadamente un 70 - 80 % del ruido ambiental. Y si les subes el volumen un poco, lo eliminas por completo.Son el punto fuerte de estos cascos. Yo la tengo siempre activa la cancelación de ruido (ANC). El modo normal consume algo menos de batería, pero ¿para qué te vas a comprar unos cascos con cancelación de ruido si luego no la usas?- Calidad del sonido. Si le he puesto un 4 en vez de 5 cinco a este apartado de la valoración es porque el usuario tiene que manipular un poco el producto. Me explico.Para poner a funcionar los cascos debes descargar la app de Soundcore. La configuración predeterminada es bastante mala y el sonido es pobre, por no decir otra cosa. Lo bueno es que la misma app tiene un ecualizador que te permite solucionar este problema.Basta ir a la personalización del ecualizador y darle al + (Crear perfil EQ).He probado las 10 configuraciones que hay por ahí rulando en la web (las subo todas al final del comentario por si alguien quiere probarlas) y como conclusión extraigo las siguientes 2 configuraciones:Iluminar-3.5 / 4 / 6 / 6 / 4.5 / 5 / 6 / 6Oscurecer-3.5 / 6 / 2. 5 / 3.5 / 2.5 / 6 / 6 / 4.5El perfil "Iluminar" es todoterreno. Lo puedes poner por defecto y funciona bien con casi cualquier tipo de canción. Si alguna canción te resulta muy estridente (porque de base ya tiene muchos agudos esa canción), puedes seleccionar el modo "Oscurecer", que las suaviza un poco.¿Cómo saber cuándo un medidor se encuentra en el punto 2.5 o -3.5 etc?El cursor de cada frecuencia funciona por redondeo, es decir, para seleccionar 2.5, empezamos a subir el cursor desde el 0. Conforme suba, marcará 1, luego 2 y así sucesivamente. ¿Cuándo paramos? En el punto exacto en el que pasa de 2 a 3, ese punto es 2.5Conforme subes el cursor, lo que hace es ir tomando valores 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4 (para todos estos valores, mostrará que vale 2) Como funciona por redondeo, cuando llega a 2.5 aparece el 3.De igual forma, si queremos el -3.5, vamos bajando desde el -3 y el primer punto en el que aparezca -4 será el -3.5De hecho es más fácil establecer una frecuencia en 2.5 que en 2. Para alcanzar un 2, será más o menos la mitad entre 2.5 y 3.5 o, simplemente, un poquillo más arriba que el 1.5Por si a alguien no le convencen esas configuraciones, aquí hay una recopilación de las configuraciones que hay rulando por ahí en foros, vídeos y demás. Aunque ya digo que después de mucho testear, me quedo con las dos que he puesto arriba (que son producto de modificar y juguetear con algunas de las de aquí abajo)1 / 3 / 2.5 / 2.5 / 3 / 3.5 / 2 / 2.5-6 / 4 / 4.5 / 4 / 2.5 / 6 / 2.5 / 2.5-3 / -2.5 / 3 / 3.5 / 4.5 / -2-6 / 6 / 2.5 / 2.5 / 1.5 / 3.5 / 0 / -2.5-4 / 3.5 / 6 / 6 / 4.5 / 5 / 4 / 6-6 / -1 / 2 / 0 / 1 / 3.5 / -1 / 0-3 / 2 / 4 / 5 / 5 / 4 / -3 / 0-5.5 / 3 / -1.5 / 5.5 / -2 / 3.5 / 4 / -6-1.5 / 4 / 3 / 3 / 2.5 / 4 / 4 / 4-5.5 / 3.5 / -1.5 / 5.5 / -2 / 3.5 / 2 / 0\nRead more', '\nMinha análise abaixo, O HYPE É REAL!Qualidade sonora:(NOTA 9.9)Vou explicar por que não é 10. Não é 10 por que o equalizador stock (padrão) que já vem no fone não é muito bom na minha opinião, pois destaca somente frequências graves e subgraves e anula todas as outras. Mas é possível corrigir isso pelo o aplicativo da soundcore, equalizando do seu jeito, pois com o uso do aplicativo isso é possível, outra razão é que em algumas músicas seu agudo fica bem forte ao ponto de incomodar, mas de toda maneira, também é possível regular isso por meio do equalizador. Gostei muito da qualidade sonora! graves, médios e agudos impecáveis! com destaque para os subgraves! (ATENÇÃO: Você só terá essa qualidade sonora com o ANC desativado)Modo de transparência(10):Amei esse modo, super útil e funciona muito bem, capta bem os sons externos, uso bastante para não ter que tirar o fone da cabeça, além de que é bem fácil ativá-lo e rápido, já que só basta tocar a concha direita do fone por 1s e já altera para o modo transparência.Duração da Bateria(10):Incrível! Dura bastante, serve bem para todo tipo de uso! bateria perfeita, não há reclamações quanto a isso.Design(8,5): Muito lindo, robusto, design mais minimalista e quase tudo de plástico, (com exceção do arco de metal) que mesmo sendo de plástico, ainda assim consegue dar um ar de fone Premium, realmente. Contudo, vi análises na internet que esse fone não é muito resistente quanto parece, de acordo com que ouvi falar, os fones em suas dobradiças depois de um médio tempo de uso começam a se quebrar, porém, vi uma maneira de resolver isso, e é simples, como vocês podem ver na foto, o fone acompanha uma case onde ele sempre está dobrado e encolhido, o que pode com médio prazo forçar as dobradiças do fone ao ponto de racharem e talvez quebrarem, por isso, eu sei que é um acessório, mas recomendo não guardar o fone sempre a case ou evitar dobra-lo muitas vezes, por que isso pode forçar e fazer ele quebrar as dobradiças. Por isso, cuidado, mas se você tiver zelo vale a pena pagar o preço por este fone, porque ele é muito incrível em som e em design, e é resistente o suficiente, só lembre-se de não forçar as dobradiças. Um adendo é que esse fone atrai marcas de dedo.Conchas de couro sintético(9,0):São muito confortáveis, dão um isolamento passivo já bastante suficiente para se isolar um pouco do mundo, enfim não tenho muito o que falar, elas realmente cobriram toda minha orelha com folga (tenho orelha pequena, contudo acho que ficará tudo bem se tiver orelhas maiores) e são bastante confortáveis e macias, muito boas mesmo, porém, infelizmente possuem problemas também, Por ser couro sintético, se o usuário não ter zelo, em menos de um ano já podem apresentar descascamento e aí seria necessário trocar, porém outros fones concorrentestambém apresentam esse problema, então não há como fugir disso, mas ainda assim, apresenta uma boa qualidade, muito boas mesmo.ANC(Cancelamento de ruídos)(7.0)Não gostei muito, é Ok, mas longe de ser ruim hein?, serve para alguns momentos como para assistir vídeos ou só se vc quiser se isolar mesmo, ele funciona e realmente te isola do ambiente, e vai atender a maioria dos usuários. Contudo, ao ouvir músicas com frequências mais graves, não gostei de uma caracterisica que o fone apresentou, pois pude notar que frequências mais agudas e graves ficam  mais apagadas, apesar que a qualidade ainda se mantém muito boa,  isso ainda dá uma certa aparência de som menos encorpado.  Além disso, ao aumentar o volume perto do máximo ou no máximo, nota-se que o fone na tentativa de entregar graves, acaba por entregar um grave muito punch (Soco), e ainda mais é um punch distorcido e que me incomodou e por isso evito de usar o noise cancelling quando estou ouvindo música. No geral não gostei muito, mas era o esperado pela faixa de preço e sim, pelo o preço funciona muito bem, e se você gosta de ASMR esse fone é perfeito para tal, ou de estudar ou apenas se desligar mais do mundo.Aperto na cabeça (10)Ele não aperta muito na cabeça, somente o suficiente para o fone se manter preso na cabeça, e isso é fantástico! (na minha opinião) ele é diferente de outros fones concorrentes. É necessário um grande esforço para que ele caia de sua cabeça, então realmente muito bom!Adendos:1.O fone treme na cabeça, se você não gosta disso, talvez não queira este fone, (mas é normal para fones desse tamanho isso ocorrer), porém em minha experiência achei isso muito bom, dá uma maior imersão no áudio.2.Sobre o áudio p2 é bom mas fica com volume ligeiramente inferior ao bluetooth. E infelizmente as funções no modo P2 de noise cancelling, equalizador, dentre outros ficam indisponíveis, uma vez que o fone fica totalmente desligado quando isto é usado.3.Para realizar chamadas eu gostei bastante do áudio, bem alto e de boa definição, sendo bem bom para realizar reuniões no zoom, meet e dentre outros programas.4.Os Codecs desse fone são: SBC, AAC + HD AUDIO, o que é muito bom, pois vários fones adotam o SBC, que só entrega uma qualidade mediana, mas que também não é ruim. Já o ACC é utilizado em Iphones por exemplo e funciona muito bem por aqui, a qualidade é superior de áudio, e por incrível que pareça para jogos funciona muito bem, o seu delay em minha experiência foi até que melhor que o esperado, mas, pode ser ruim para alguns usuários, pois esse fone não oferece nenhuma função de diminuição de Delay para jogos, pois ele não foi feito para esse público.4.O bluetooth adotado aqui é 5.0, muito bom e com boa estabilidade, não tive problemas5. Seus botões são muito bons, rapidamente você é capaz de se acostumar, e funcionam bem para as funções que lhe foram designadas.6. Em relação ao atendimento ao cliente da OCTO SHOP BR, amei muito, pois todas minhas dúvidas foram respondidas rapidamente e eles procuraram me ajudar o máximo possível! muito obrigado pelo o incrível atendimento, e em relação aos correios, vai depender da sua sorte, mas comigo veio antes do prazo e tudo certinho, sem a caixa estar amassada nem nada, além de que não há necessidade de se preucupar com taxação, já que a própria loja já cuida disso.Resumo: Enfim, recomendo este fone sim com toda certeza de olhos fechados, tem seus problemas como qualquer coisa na vida, mas é muito bom mesmo, mais do que recomendado, O HYPE É REAL!É isso espero ter ajudado alguém a comprar ou a não comprar este fone.\nRead more', '\nEs difícil encontrar un auricular hoy día la verdad. Mil reviews (muchas de ellas pagadas con el producto gratis), y mil modelos tanto de bluetooth como de cable.En el audio el más dinero suele ir relacionado con el mejor calidad. Por eso si no podemos en ese momento o no nos apetece comprar algo demasiado caro, la amplitud de modelos a elegir no se reduce.Esta reseña parte de la base de que un auricular bluetooth jamás nos dará la calidad de audio de uno con cable por muy bueno o avanzado que sea el codec que utilice. En base a eso, en Internet hay un modelo en el que la mayoría de los compradores (o reseñadores de pago) están de acuerdo, Soundcore Life Q30.Después de la tralla que os he dado, al turrón, puntualizaré lo que quiero destacar:- Audio, graves, muchísimos graves. Olvidaos de la respuesta plana (cosa que yo prefiero y me encanta) o de predominancia de agudos. Soundcore le da mucha presencia de graves a este modelo sea el perfil que sea el que elijamos en la ecualización. Por supuesto indagando un poco por la red encontraremos la ecualización perfecta para obtener un sonido HiFi (con las diferencia existentes al no tener codec LDAC el cual sólo está en su hermano mayor de 100€, el Q35). La pongo al final de la reseña. Es por ello que evitad los comentarios en los que ponen pegas al producto por su graves. Se pueden reducir muchísimo y una de las gracias que tiene el producto es la personalización en su sonido. ¿Y por qué me quedo con el modelo si hay que afinar tanto la ecualización? Seguid leyendo.- Ecualizador, como comenté antes, gracias a él mismo podemos aumentar agudos, hacer más plano el sonido, potenciar graves (más aún de como vienen de fábrica), etc, una virguería.- Cancelación de sonido. Las cosas claras, no son los Sony XM3 o XM4, que no os engañen, pero por 59.95€ no existe nada igual en el mercado. El ANC funciona sorprendentemente bien y con gran calidad respecto al audio, por lo que no lo empeora.- Comodidad, todos los auriculares de diadema meten calor en la orejas, ya sea por la piel sintética o por la tela si es el caso. En verano todos nos dará calor, en invierno lógicamente menos. Una vez obviado esto las espumas parecen foam blandito que se adaptan a la cabeza super bien y no te enteras apenas que los llevas puesto, un 10 por el fabricante la verdad.- Bolsa de almacenaje, aquí no me ha gustado nada lo que ha hecho Soundcore. En las reviews del producto venía una bolsa distinta a la que están dando ahora. Antes tenía la forma de los auriculares en una especie de foam y con un bolsillo para los cables, ahora (ved foto adjunta) no es así y no hay bolsillo para los cables sino un bolsito que se cierra. Muy mal, de hecho les he escrito para comentarles el detalle, a ver qué me dicen.- Cable, el audio por cable es normalito, no son unos Audio Technica ni unos Beyerdynamics, da tanta calidad como por bluetooth pero sólo ellos lo saben, en la última actualización 2.30 se han cargado el ANC con la conexión cableada. Espero que lo solucionen.En resumen, no hay nada mejor por 60 euros, así de simple. Puedes probar 100 marcas, pero es que ni los Sony bluetooth de 30/50 euros se acercan a la personalización de sonido o al ANC que tienen los Q30. Reconozco que me desencanté mucho al ponerlos en funcionamiento y ver tantos graves, pero cuando consigues ecualizarlos, son una delicia. Y si a alguien le cabe duda, SÍ, el auricular lo compré de mi bolsillo 100%.NOTA: La ecualización la podéis poner así = -6, +5, +4, +2, +2, +6, 0, +1\nRead more', '\nBuena calidad de construcción, almohadillas cómodas pero de espuma de poca densidad lo que repercute en un aislamiento pasivo del ruido mejorable. La diadema és ancha, yo tengo un cabezón y no me aprieta nada, preferiría que el ajuste fuera más firme, aunque va a gustos.La aplicación muy bien, permite actualizar firmware, elegir ecualizador, crear uno a tu gusto y está la función de escuchar sonidos relajantes de la naturaleza, con o son anc, muy buena idea.El sonido és bueno por el precio, con cuerpo. Tienes muchas opciones de ecualización pre-fijadas si bien yo funciono con las que he creado yo, a mi gusto. Recomiendo ésta última opción para tener un sonido adaptado a tu gusto.Respecto a la cancelación de sonido, decir 2 cosas.La 1a que és flojilla, no cancela mucho aunque de notarse se nota,pero poca cosa, no entiendo las muchas reviews que dicen que es tan buena... claro que por el precio no podemos ir de tiquis-miquis.La 2a cosa y , lo que más me ha decepcionado de este auricular, és que el sonido con el anc conectado és malo. El campo se estrecha un mundo, suena como si escucharas a través de un tubo, el sonido se transforma a peor por lo que mejor escucharlo con el anc desconectado, mucho mejor.Me daré unos dias más para darle rodaje y ver que tal, si no mejoran los devolveré. No tiene sentido que unos auriculares con anc y buen sonido, se vuelvan malos una vez conectas el anc.Addenda1.Después de 2 dias de uso intensivo puedo matizar el problema con el anc. Hay un problema de software , que no sé si afecta a todos, o a un lote de auriculares en particular, ya que he visto reviews de otros usuarios que les sucede lo mismo. El tema es que cuando cambias entre los modos anc de ‘interior’ _‘exterior’ se escucha el sonido mal, como a lata. Por ejemplo,  si estás en el modo ‘interior’ de la anc y pasas a ‘exterior’ el sonido se vuelve pésimo,  O al activar la anc desde el modo normal que suena a lata. O si estás en anc i la quitas volviendo al modo normal, se escucha a lata unos segundos y luego por sí solo y sin tocar nada vuelve a oirse bien.En resumen, hay fallos de sonido en la transición entre modos anc i al activar el anc. Espero lo solucionen en la próxima actualización de firmware, sinó los devolveré.Addenda 2Después de contactar con el servicio técnico y decirme que pruebe a reiniciar los auriculares o que lo vincule a otro móvil, me sigue pasando el mismo error. Devueltos.Addenda 3Después de lo sucedido, el servicio técnico me envió otro auricular de prueba pudiendo verificar que los anteriores me vinieron defectuosos. Ahora se escuchan estupendamente (por el precio) y no dan ningún tipo de problema cuando cambio entre tipos de cancelación de ruido. Gracias por la excelencia del servicio post-venta, un 10. Ahora sí puedo recomendarlos honestamente.\nRead more', "\nImballo e tempi di spedizione come tradizione Amazon. Le mie cuffie ordinate la sera sono arrivate la mattina del giorno dopo. Esperienza d'uso completamente soddisfatto. Funzionalità, occorre fare lamano ai tasti che sono piccoli ma ben disposti, solidi e con un feedback tattile ottimo. Comprate ad occhi shiusi, rapporto qualità/prezzo/prestazioni senza eguali.Se volete leggere nello specifico prestazioni, dati tecnici e consigli di uso, proseguite.La scatola di imballo, contiene una custodia semi-rigida in tessuto mesh del peso di gr 422 (cuffie ed accessori) con chiusura a zip con cuciture ricoperte da una fettuccia, una targhetta cucita sul bordo interno, con stilizzate le cuffie, indica in che posizione vanno rimesse a posto. Esternamente è cucina una cinghia ad anello per il trasporto (quindi non il solito sacchetto morbido in vellutino).All’interno della custodia sono presenti le cuffie gr 267 (fate una foto per capire come vanno rimesse a posto – oppure vedi foto allegata alla recensione, ovvero, l’archetto va appoggiato sul supporto in gomma presente nella custodia e non all’interno di esso). In un sacchettino di velluto, sono presenti cavo di ricarica di 60 cm da USB ad USB – C (senza spina che va comprata a parte oppure usate quella del vostro cellulare o tablet) ed cavo audio cm 128 con il jack da 3,5 mm per il collegamento senza bluetooth ad una entrata audio.L’archetto regolabile con scatti precisi, è in metallo e ben imbottito nella parte che poggia sulla testa. I padiglioni, con driver da 40 cm, sono di un materiale in simil-pelle traspirante e molto morbido, che poggia sulla testa circondando il padiglione, creando un effetto “ventosa” leggero e piacevole ed isolando in parte, meccanicamente, dai rumori esterni. Le cuffie sono stabili muovendo la testa e la regolazione dell’archetto è stabile.PADIGLIONE SINISTRO: sono presenti la presa USB – C per la ricarica, vicino al bottone di accensione (premere per accendere, tenere premuto per spegnere fino alla accensione di un led rosso) che serve anche per l’accoppiamento Bluetooth, tenere premuto qualche secondo, fino alla accensione di un led blu e bianco alternati, che avvisano della ricerca di dispositivi bluetooth nelle vicinanze, quando la luce blu sola lampeggia, indica che l’accoppiamento è eseguito con successo, ed il tasto per la funzione di “Cancellazione del Rumore” in tre modalità:TOTALE: tutti i rumori vengono cancellati.TRASPARENZA: si sentono i rumori esterni “captati” dai 4 microfoni presenti sulle cuffie, utile per sentire una persona che ci parla o mentre si passeggia per sentire le macchine.SPENTO: cancellazione passiva, ovvero i rumori si sentono volume ed udito permettendo.Poggiando un dispositivo NFC sulla parte esterna del padiglione sinistro, è possibile fare l’accoppiamento istantaneo senza usare la ricerca con il bluetooth.Ogni volta che viene premuto il tasto “CN” una voce in cuffia ci avvisa della modalità attivata.PADIGLIONE DESTRO: ci sono i bottoni del Volume Su e Volume Giù (per riconoscerlo ha un pallino in rilievo) che se premuti in maniera prolungata cambiano traccia andando avanti o indietro nell’elenco delle tracce, un terzo bottone con funzione Play/Pausa, se premuto in maniera prolungata, attiva l’Assistente Vocale, veramente funzionante. Infine vi è l’entrata per il cavo audio.Pigiando qualche secondo, sulla parte esterna del padiglione si attiva la funzione “Trasparenza” (ovvero, i microfoni della cuffia fanno sentire i rumori ambientali che ci circondano in cuffia), pigiando di nuovo si disattiva tornando alla impostazione precedentemente impostata. Una voce nella cuffia ci avvisa della modalità “Trasparenza Disattivata/Attivata”.Il tutto è accompagnato dalla applicazione “Soundcore Life Q30” scaricabile sul sito del produttore, per Android ed Apple.La applicazione permette di:- Equalizzare le cuffie con 22 Preset non sovra-scrivibili, ma modificabili e salvabili con altro nome, quindi in tutto 44 equalizzazioni possibili.- Funzione “Qualità del Sonno” con 11 suoni ambientali (pioggia, vento, suoni della montagna, etc) sovrapponibili ed equalizzabili nella loro sovrapposizione, ovvero un suono più forte e l’altro più delicato, con timer ed auto-spegnimento completamente personalizzabili. Utile per esempio quando ci si deve concentrare o quando ci si vuole rilassare per studiare o per leggere un bel libro.- “Rumore Bianco” sono dei preset di suoni creati da voi o dalla Comunity, eh già, perché con l’app ci si può collegare anche ad una comunity di persone che usano i prodotti Anker, (cuffie ed altro) con un forum dedicato per chiedere consigli.ATTENZIONE: se le cuffie vengono collegate con il cavo ad una fonte audio, il bluetooth si disattiva e la applicazione “Soundcore Life Q30” non può essere usata cosi come tutte le impostazioni dell’equalizzatore delle cuffie, dovrete quindi usare l’equalizzatore della periferica alla quale siete collegati tramite cavo ed il microfono della periferica alla quale siete collegati tramite cavo audio, per parlare.Le cuffie sono dotate di protocollo bluetooth 5 quindi, possono essere collegate contemporaneamente a due periferiche differenti contemporaneamente, posto che entrambe abbiano il bluetooth 5, ed ovviamente funzionerà una periferica alla volta. Quindi potete vedere un film sul pc e tenere collegato il cellulare e con le cuffie ascoltare e parlare nel caso di chiamata in arrivo sul cellulare.Nel caso l’accoppiamento con una periferica non funzionasse, tenete premuto il tasto di accensione e il tasto di Volume Su per resettarle fino a quando il led lampeggia ripetutamente rosso e blu. Non occorrerà rifare l’accoppiamento in altre periferiche già accoppiate, si resettano solo le cuffie.DATI TECNICI:- Silk Diaphragm Drivers da 40mm certificati Hi-Res Audio. Questo significa che le cuffie possono riprodurre l'intero spettro dell'Audio Hi-Res (assumendo che il file musicale che state ascoltando sia anch'esso Hi-Res), ovvero, superano le specifiche dei CD audio, e cioè 16 bit di profondità e 44,1 kHz di frequenza di campionamento.In genere l'orecchio umano può udire i suoni nell'intervallo di frequenza che va dai 20 Hz ai 20000 Hz, anche se molti adulti non sono in grado di sentire sopra i 16000 Hz avere un range più elevato  16Hz – 40kHz consiste in una qualità sonora veramente elevata, equiparabile solo con cuffie di ben altra fascia di prezzo.- Impedenza 16 Ω . Se collegate tramite cavo, la resa in frequenza, sarà più elevata rispetto a cuffie con impedenza maggiore, ad esempio 32 Ω come la maggior parte delle cuffie da studio. In parole semplici, se le cuffie le userete collegate tramite cavo audio con telefono e/o tablet quanto più l’impedenza è minore tanto meno sarà la corrente richiesta per funzionare e quindi necessiterete di meno volume per sentire le cuffie. Quindi con periferiche come cellulari e tablet il volume di ascolto sarà maggiore in quanto le cuffie necessiteranno di meno alimentazione.- Bluetooth 5.0 (range di 15 metri) quindi possibilità di connessione con due dispositivi contemporaneamente.- Digital Hybrid ANC, Multi-mode Noise Cancellation.- Possibilità di aggiornare il firmware delle cuffie se disponibile tramite la applicazione Soundcore.- Funzione Transparency, ovvero i microfoni sui padiglioni riproducono in cuffia i rumori ambientali sovrapposti alla sorgente audio che stiamo ascoltando.- supporto all’NFC, possibilità di accoppiare le cuffie a dispositivi provvisti di NFC. Non è possibile fare l’accoppiamento con NFC se le cuffie sono collegate tramite cavo.- 2 microfoni per le chiamate.- porta USB Type-C per la ricarica, che avviene in circa 2 ore,  ATTENZIONE quando sono in carica le cuffie non si possono usare neanche con il cavo. Per usarle con il  cavo occorre un minimo di ricarica, considerando che supporta la RICARICA VELOCE in solo 5 minuti di carica 4 ore di utilizzo, il problema non si pone.- batteria 720 mAh. 40 ore di riproduzione musicale con ANC attivato (60 ore con ANC disattivato).- Audio codec supportati SBC, AAC, i codec aptX non sono supportati quindi niente audio Flac, dovrete rivolgervi al modello superiore le Q35 ma ad altri costi.ATTENZIONESe utilizzate le cuffie in bluetooth, su di un pc per ascoltare dei video e contemporaneamente le avete collegate al telefono sempre in bluetooth, per rispondere alle chiamate, disabilitate il microfono del pc, altrimenti interferisce con il microfono delle cuffie ed in chiamata avrete un fastidioso eco di ritorno. Contemporaneamente, abilitate sul pc le cuffie come solo audio (icona delle cuffie senza il microfono) perché le cuffie collegate come “hand set” (icona cuffie con microfono) hanno un suono mono che viene riprodotto uguale in entrambi i padiglioni, quindi niente effetto stereo.Se usate il pc sia per video-chiamate ed fruizione video e musica e siete collegati anche con il telefono (a meno di non convivere con il ritorno eco in cuffia), abilitate nella scheda audio del pc le cuffie come periferica audio e voce, (icona con le cuffie e microfono) ed anche come periferica audio e disabilitate il microfono del pc. Al contempo abilitate le cuffie sul telefono come auricolare, non come “handset”. Potrete ascoltare sul pc la musica o i video in stereo e parlare tramite le cuffie quando riceverete una telefonata video sul pc e potrete rispondere ad una chiamata sul cellulare ascoltando la chiamata in cuffia e parlando nel microfono del cellulare.ATTENZIONE:Se collegate le cuffie tramite cavo, potrete collegarvi ad una sola periferica, il bluetooth si spegne e così anche i microfoni delle cuffie, dovrete quindi usare il microfono della periferica alla quale siete collegati tramite cavo.Preferite il cavo se siete amanti del buon suono ma il Bluetooth va più che bene in ogni altro caso.Se avete altri dubbi, sul sito del produttore troverete dei video di istruzioni per ogni funzione delle cuffie ed un forum con una comunity molto vasta per porre qualsiasi quesito attinente alle cuffie.\nRead more"]}{'title': '        HAMMER Bash Max Over The Ear Wireless Bluetooth Headphones with Mic, Touch Control, Deep Bass, Upto 18 Hours Playtime, Bluetooth 5.3, Workout/Travel (Black)       ', 'reviews': ["\nHonestly this headphone is ratio'd by Noise Two in almost every single aspect.And just so you know it doesn't look nearly as good as in photos.Albeit, it's not a bad headphone by any means.Despite Noise Two being better, I'm keeping this one cuz it can swivel.Its also slightly more comfortable than that since it larger ear cups.As far as touch controls are concerned, they aren't faulty or anything, you just have to get used to it.\nRead more", "\nFirst thing about this product is this is very comfortable around your ears and plus this product is worth if you looking for very comfy headphones then should definitely but this and the best part is sound quality of this product is amazing mind-blowing go for it guys and don't worry about battery life it stays till 2-3 days\nRead more", '\nThis products sound quality is really very good.

The built quality is amazing, all around it's plastic with foam on the headband but it's very sturdy, the headband is not too loose, slightly tight but it does loosen up a bit eventually2. Comfort - The ear foams are ok/meh but do feel a little uncomfortable after like 2 or 3 hrs, and not much ventilation so It might a get a little hot during the summers3. Mic - The mic is also pretty good, it does a poor job filtering surrounding noise, you wouldn't be able to hear the noise but it lowers your sound4. Sound Quality - I'm not an audiphile but the sound is also good, not too high of a bass but it gets pretty loud without bleeding5. Latency - There isn't much latency or any latency at all that I noticed while daily use, ie on YouTube, media play etc, but there is a significant lag when gaming SO DON'T BUY THIS FOR GAMING6. Connectivity- Connectivity is also ok but not too great, sometimes the connection does breaks and after 5,6 seconds it reconnects automatically, it doesn't happen too often but it does happen usually after long hours of usage7. Battery Life - battery Life is pretty good, I can go 3 days without charging with pretty heavy usage, the battery indication (in the app) is a little off though,meaning it might show 100% within 15-20 mins of charging but the battery drains quickly, you gotta let it charge for an additional 20/30 mins after hitting 100% for the battery to actually be full8.

On the one hand, they excel in terms of features and audio quality, but on the other, their long-term durability is a significant concern when it comes to the wired version.First, let's discuss the positive aspects. The Samsung earphones come packed with features that enhance the listening experience. The sound quality is impressive, delivering crisp and clear audio across a wide range of frequencies. They also offer great noise isolation, which is perfect for shutting out the outside world and immersing yourself in your music or podcasts.The earphones are comfortable to wear for extended periods, and they fit securely in your ears, which is a big plus for active individuals or commuters. The in-line microphone and remote control make it easy to manage calls and playback without reaching for your phone, adding convenience to your daily routine.However, the Achilles' heel of these earphones is their durability, especially when it comes to the wired version. Over time, I found that the wires tend to fray and weaken, leading to audio issues and sometimes complete loss of functionality. It's disappointing to see such a great product compromised by the relatively short lifespan of the wires.If you're considering purchasing these Samsung earphones, I'd strongly recommend the wireless version for better durability. While they come at a higher price point, they eliminate the wire-related durability concerns and provide a more extended period of reliable usage.In conclusion, the Samsung earphones offer excellent audio quality and a range of features that enhance the listening experience.

The best I had is the redragon mouse. I will still consider the redragon mouse as best in terms of  the softness in clicking any button. After 4 years of using my redragon mouse (still no issues) I feel to change my mouse to test the additional fire button that I dont have in my older mouse.These are the pros I found after playing Apex for 3 hours.1. All buttons are very clicky and you will feel good to press each button. Except the scroll button click which is a little hard to press comparing my redragon mouse. (A con) I got used to it now.2. All the side buttons can be identifiable while touching them and you dont need to see those. A very good feature which is ignored by many Big brands.3. All buttons are programmable using the software. In the box you will have a card specifying the url to download the kreo software.4. I kept the fire button as default and believe me, pistols and all single fire weapons (like g7 scout) are fun to play. There is a bug I noticed. Using the software if you change the fire button and again set it, then there is a issue with rapid fire. Make sure you set the default settings for this and change other settings but not the repid fire one5. Set any colour based on your setup. RGB looks awesome. Support many pre configured RGB thems like waves, breathing and many more along with single static color. And its true RGB.6. This supports 1000 hz polling rate and I have tested using 3rd party software.7. There are many other features on the software which I haven't tested. In one word you have full control on your mouse.8. There is a small button at the base of this mouse and you can customize it too. I kept it to change the RGB.9. Mouse texture feels very comfortable in hand.10. Braided cable and very good quality.11. Good gaming sensor(PMW 3327). I haven't feel any mouse movement glitches. It is not the best but great if you compare with a generic sensor.12. Two kreo hawk stickers are provided on the box.13. You can set dpi from 200 to 12000 range and unlike many brands you can set any value multiply by 100. Means you can set 200, 300, 400 and so on till 12000.Now lets discuss the cons I have faced -1. Scroll button is a little hard. I have replaced my first kreo hawk mouse as the first delivered mouse had a supsr hard scroll button. Replacement had a better scroll button click. But still harder than my redragon mouse. Make sure to test your mouse and replace if needed.2. The ergonomics is good for bigger hands only. If you have small hand you may ignore this design.3. Provided cable length is very short. If you have your system far away than its not a good option. My redragon mouse have very long usb cable.4. In some static RGB colour you will feel gaps in light if you look closely.5. Delivery time is more in Kolkata location. Its coming from Bangalore location.6. Not sure of any after sales support. I have send them an email 2 weeks back and still no reply. So be careful.My own final conclusion -I have purchased this for around 1140 and I had to replace the first mouse. Comparing the price it is definitely a very good option. I have to adjust myself with the scroll button click.1 star less as it needs some improvements mentioned in the cons.Thanks for reading!!!!

The pointer movement and accuracy is good, at least for my casual gaming and general computing needs. I switched to this mouse from an old Logitech M510 which was starting to experience very poor wireless performance every time the battery dropped a little bit, like well before the low battery indicator came on. The Amazon mouse is a similar size though it's shaped slightly different. It's only taken me a few minutes to get used to the difference.Some minor gripes (and they're pretty nit-picky, I will admit):1. The cord with the nice cloth braided outer cover is nice, but the way it's bundled in the packaging means it's stiffly retaining the folds and bends running across my desk. I've tried to straighten it out to some effect, hopefully it will relax over time.2. The forward and back buttons on the left side are somewhat oddly positioned - I think they would be better a little further forward. Also there's no strong distinguishing shape or texture to help you know which button your thumb is on. I don't use these buttons much so it's not a big deal to me, but it may be to others.3. The textured feel of the whole mouse is great, but the rubber side grip on the right side doesn't go far enough forward to catch where my ring finger rests.All things considered, so far it seems like a great mouse considering the affordable price point.\nRead more", '\n== EMBALAJE ==El embalaje es una caja de cartón con una pegatina que indica el nombre del producto.

The side buttons for Back/Forward are useful in almost any situation so that is definitely a plus! Adjust DPI button, is something that I don't usually use but is very handy to have so another plus for that.One of the things that surprised me most is that the cable was braided and the USB was gold-plated.

Meine erste Razer-Maus, die Diamond-Back verrichtete mehr als 10 Jahre ohne Probleme ihre Arbeit. Danach hatte ich die Viper, dann die Lancehead TE, die vom Design her mein absoluter Favorit war und bleibt. Doch leider gab es immer wieder Probleme mit dem Mausrad weil das Gehaeuse wie ein Staubsauger alles aufnahm und die Kontakte immer wieder mit Staub belegt waren.Jetzt habe ich mich fuer eine Reddragon entschieden weil sie vom Design her, den Razer-Maeusen sehr nahe kommt und ich seit Jahren ein Reddragon Keyboard habe mit dem ich immer zufrieden war.Die Maus:Was man hier an Leistung fuers Geld bekommt ist m.M.n unschlagbar. Die Maus fuehlt sich hochwertig an und macht ihren Job in Spielen einwandfrei. Sie liegt gut in meiner Hand (mittelgross, von Handballen-Mitte bis Mittelfinger-Spitze sind es 19 cm) und gleitet geraeuschlos ueber mein Mauspad. Auch die Tasten sind bei Benutzung sehr leise.Die Software:Die Software dazu ist einwandfrei und auch um einiges Benutzerfreundlicher als das voellig ueberladene Razer-Synapse Tool.Eine klare und moderne Oberflaeche bietet alles was man braucht um die Maus seinen persoenlichen Beduerfnissen anzuppassen. Kein Schnick-Schnack und alles ist uebersichtlich angeordnet und man muss sich nicht bis in den Keller vorklicken um irgendwelche Features zu aktivieren.Fuer einen Gamer-Freak mag es evtl. zuwenig an kunterbunter Lichtorgelspielerei sein, aber fuer den Normal-Benutzer absolut ausreichend.Empfehlung:Aus meiner Sicht eine absolute Kaufempfehlung!Habe die Maus jetzt erst ein paar Tage in Benutzung (Stand: Sept 2023).

However, I will leave these topics for other reviewers.My main focus in this review is the software, or seeming lack thereof.

I had to do a Google search for the Redragon website.  Once there, I went to the "Software" section, clicked on the icon for the M612 mouse, and chose to download the software.I had forgotten about RAR compression, because it is no 1997, but wouldn\'t you know it, the Redragon software came in .rar compression.  I took a minute to install winRAR, which is free and simple.  I think extracted the installation file, ran it, and the software was installed.  The software is fairly self-explanatory.  You can customize the function of every button, and there are a lot of options for customizing the mouse\'s lighting.  Overall, this is a pretty amazing mouse for the price.If I had to find anything to complain about, I would like it to be a bit bigger.

The over-ear cups provide a snug fit, and the cushioning ensures long listening sessions are enjoyable. The build quality is solid, making them durable for everyday use.Sound quality is impressive, with clear and balanced audio. The bass is punchy without overpowering the mids and highs. Whether you're listening to music, watching movies, or taking calls, the audio experience is satisfying.These headphones are wireless and offer seamless connectivity via Bluetooth. The battery life is typically good, providing hours of usage on a single charge. The controls are intuitive, allowing you to adjust volume, skip tracks, and manage calls effortlessly and adjust ANC mode to normal mode and vice versa.One potential downside could be the pricing, as Boat Nirvana headphones might be on the higher end of the budget scale.

Right earcup is having very less bass, sent it for warranty claim but they don't cover bass in the warranty.2. Ambient mode is also not working properly in right earcup and they also not solved this issue in warranty claim and rejected my claim.3. I use headphones for work and study but they did not meant for that, even you can't wear them for 1 hour they will cause a lot of pain in your head and around ear.4. ANC is pretty average for this price range, but comfort is  -10/5 Don't trust on YouTube reviews because i trusted on YouTube review and wasted my money.If you are thinking why i have not mentioned about sound quality i think sound quality doesn't matter when comfort is zero.My simple suggestion is if you are planning to buy over ear good ANC headphones save some more money and go for sony you will get good sony headphones under 10,000/-But don't go for this product.Update - They have finally replaced my product after 1.5 months of testing my patience.

The premium material and all as boasted in the review videos, well, a glossy hard plastic doesn't mean it's premium.However, I would give it to the hard plastic it used, the metal hinges and leather cup quality, it sure is durable compared with the other headphones.Sound:I may say it's average or not so good for someone who wants genuine sound. I mean it's too much manipulated for my ears to listen this muffed up sound no matter what mode or settings I play it on.Just annoying it is as it makes no sense of having a 40mm driver to listen the muffed up sound. It may take a while for me to adjust to this sound. An custom app or something could have made it a better experience to get a customized sound profile.Comfort:These are heavy. I don't have any comparison criteria but just 40 mins of wearing these, made my ear heated and sweaty.But didn't caused any pain of any sort which is a good things I guess.The battery and mic quality, well I have a long way to explore that aspect.

I got this for around 4999 INR, and for the price it fits my use case perfectly.Pretty comfortable on the head, but I\'ve not used super high-end headphones either but this can easily remain on your head without any discomfort for 1-2 hours at a stretch. Although because of the material used on the earcups, you might feel a bit sweaty and hot around your ears if you\'re in a hot environment (happened to me a couple of times, but it\'s not too much of an issue).The sound quality is fine. Again, I\'m not going to pretend to be an audiophile, but it does seem to be tuned for the Bass-ier sounds than an even sound. Music is great, but doesn\'t do voices as well but it\'s definitely above average and great for the price.The connectivity is great. I love dual-pairing and the fast-pair functionality. Although I do have some issues with how unpredictably it falls asleep when not in use - sometimes even when it\'s not in use, it\'ll stay on for the whole night, and sometimes it\'ll fall asleep when not in use for 10-15 mins. But it might be something with the way I\'m using it. I have it paired to 2 devices all the time.The battery life is great for me, use it for 4-5 hours in a day, and lasts about a week. Charges pretty fast too. Top up for 10 mins will get an hour or two of listening. (but read the noise cancellation section also)The build quality is average or leaves a little to be desired. It feels very cheap, but more importantly, the first thought I had when I picked it up was that "It feels really fragile" and that it will break if I so much as look at it the wrong way. Sometimes, you hear the plastic creaking when you put it on or take it off (Yikes)The noise cancellation is just bad. It makes a marginal difference to the listening experience, and only blocks out really low sounds (the fan, AC and other low humming sounds) but does not do anything to anything more than that, if it\'s raining you\'ll very likely be able to hear the rain clearly.You\'ll still be able to hear people perfectly, sometimes even clearer than without the NC one as it blocks out other ambient noises lmao. and it seems to have this \'directional\' problem where it\'s great it cancelling sounds coming from infront of you, but not so much for things coming from the sides and behind.But don\'t get this for the NC, just pretend it\'s not there. Also because the NC cuts down the battery life to almost half the normal use with a minimal upgrade to listening experience.Although they advertise it as foldable and it can indeed be folded into a smaller size. It feels even more fragile in the folded position and the folded position decreased the total area used by around 30-40% only. Not worth folding.The last thing I hate is the wired connection. For some weird reason, it\'s not a 3.5mm to 3.5mm aux jack like you would normally see. It\'s a weird 2.5mm to 3.5mm connector. So if you want to connect it like that, make sure you carry around the bundled cable they give.\nRead more', '\nThis is my review of JBL Tune 710BT after one year of purchase.This was my first headphone purchase. I have only used earphones before. I\'m writing this because I\'m unsure what to expect for this price. I bought them for Rs.4000. In this one year, I can say that I have used these headphones a lot and have a few points to say about it.Pros -1. Battery life - They mention it\'s 50 hrs and it is. I have completed the series "Peaky Blinders" on a single charge with 20% battery remaining. That\'s some next-level battery life, considering the driver\'s size.2. Sound quality - The sound quality (excluding the bass) is pretty good, what some would say is a classic JBL signature.3. Comfort - It is very comfortable. As I said, I come from an earphone background, so it took a while to get used to it.4. Dual-device connectivity - This feature is a blessing and works effortlessly. But it only works effortlessly on Windows. I have an Android (Samsung) phone and tried connecting it with Windows(10/11) and Linux (Debian) systems as well. I faced some hiccups on the Linux side, but that can be due to incompatible audio drivers.5. Charging Speed - It takes more than an hour to charge from 0 to 100. But a quick 10-minute charge can last for hours.Cons -1. Sound quality (Bass) - It\'s too low. You can feel it only at higher volumes (>85%).2. Built quality - I don\'t know if I can expect a well-built headphone at Rs.4000. It is comfortable, but after a few hours of continuous usage, my ear gets sweaty, and I have to remove them for a few minutes. And all of this from staying indoors. DO NOT use this outdoors for jogging or running or at the gym. I tried my best to keep them away from sweat or wet hair, but as you can see from the photos, the leather (or whatever that material is) starts to deteriorate. The stitching of the right ear cup suddenly gave up one day. I tried to fix it using fevicol (glue), and you can see how they look from the photos.3. Over-the-ear - It is not over the ear. I have tried a few over-the-ear headphones, and this is not it. I think I have a decent-sized ear, and the rims of my ear touch and sometimes get folded by the inner cushion of the ear cups of this headphone. These are a little bit smaller to be called over-the-ear headphones.Conclusions -1. Don\'t buy this if you sweat a lot or plan to take this outdoors.2. Don\'t expect bass from it. My Rs.500 earphone (Realme Buds 2) has more bass than this.3. Other than bass, the sound is good.4. They are not fully Over-the-ear. So, some people might feel uncomfortable.5. A decent pair of headphones, but I expected a better-built quality for Rs.4000.\nRead more', "\nBeen using this for a month and here's what I can describe about this product. NOT the best product but for the price point in this brand? I really can't complain. The build product feels cheap, like plastic or maybe is it plastic? I don't know but it feels cheap with matte finish and simple design.The meat of the product, The sound quality is fine but the bass, I won't call it great yet won't call it decent. If I was given a scale to rate the bass of this speaker, I would give it 6.5 or 7 at best out of 10. Noise Cancelling is great here, haven't gotten issue with this part so far.The battery is fine, since I use it on everyday basis I think, I can get at best 3 to 4 hours a day without charging for a week's use.The comfort is assuring, I never once found discomfort using this product nor irritations, able to move around hassle-free. The cushion, however looks rugged which I personally don't like, was comfy providing protection to my hear.Honestly, I'd give this product 3.5 or 3.75 out of 5 overall, as I am not a huge fan of it's bass, it's just on the borderline mark, and the placeholder on where you need to charge, this particular product made me feel I was solving a rubix cube to find the placeholder. I have gone through the instructions but, at times when I'm on rush or something related to it, I don't find comfort finding the ports on this product.\nRead more", '\nO fone é realmente muito bom e, apesar de não ter cancelamento ativo de ruído, a construção dele faz com que quando você o coloque ele abafe consideravelmente barulhos externos e isso foi uma surpresa bastante positiva, pois fones com cancelamento ativo de ruído são bem mais caros e esse, só com a espuma na orelha e o ajuste dele, supre um pouquinho disso. Por conta dessa característica, algumas pessoas podem achar que ele aperta muito. Bom, ele aperta, mas na minha opinião, apenas um pouco, não é muito a ponto de ser desconfortável a longo prazo, é um aperto "padrão" para esses fones sem fio.O som dele é incrível, como já era de se esperar da JBL. Tem um volume ótimo, sem precisar estar sempre no máximo e tem graves e agudos incríveis. E a bateria? DURA MUITOOOO! Eu uso ele todo dia, num uso médio e ele dura mais de 4 dias a bateria fácil e para carregar, não cheguei a contar quanto tempo, mas também carrega super rápido (como eu disse, não cheguei a contar mas pela minha baixíssima percepção de tempo, parece ter sido uns 10 min kkkkkkkkkk). A construção física do fone também parece ótima, não tem nada "balançando", solto, ou algo do tipo. Tudo parece estar onde deveria estar.Entretanto, algumas considerações que pode desagradar alguns mas para mim, até agora, que já tô usando a mais de um mês, está tudo ok, tudo normal: A capinha que reveste a espuma que vai na orelha parece ser um "saquinho plástico bem vagabundo", como se fosse rasgar logo logo mas até agora está tudo certo, nada de ruim aconteceu. O cabo para carregamento (USB tipo C) entra só até a metade nele e parece que esse é o normal, pois não entra mais do que isso e carrega normalmente, mas com certeza é estranho (até pq a gente fica com vontade de forçar para entrar um pouco mais). Se você usar ele ligado, mas a um certo tempo sem estar tocando nada (+10 min), ele começa a dar um leve zumbidinho, bem bem baixinho no lado direito. Não sei se é só o meu, mas acontece isso.Por último, eu comprei ele para ser meu fone para tudo, inclusive para eu usar nas aulas online do Google Meet, falando e ouvindo, entretanto, flopou totalmente pq a internet fica muito ruim quando usamos ele no Meet, eu não sei por quê, mas é inviável assistir aula por ele pq fica direto caindo e não dá nem pra abrir outras páginas no computador, mas assim que você o desliga, tudo volta magicamente a funcionar bem. É estranho pois uso ele na TV em plataformas de streaming de filmes, uso ele no celular para tudo, uso ele no notebook para YouTube enquanto faço milhares de outras coisas no computador e não tem nenhum problema, mas se eu abrir o Google Meet o uso da internet no Notebook fica imprestável se estiver usando esse fone.\nRead more', '\nBom, como não vi ninguém aqui relatar o que eu vivi com esse produto, me sinto na obrigação de comunicar aquelas variáveis  sobre o produto que você só descobre com o tempo e pela repetição dos mesmos impasses e armadilhas nas três ocasiões em que comprei. Isso já virou uma saga. Essa foi a terceira vez que eu comprei um JBL sem fio. Os dois primeiros ainda eram o de 500, e há seis meses atrás comprei esse do 510. Pois bem, venho aqui seis meses depois relatar o que só os usuários intensivos descobrem: que esta porcaria tem uma obsolescência programada monstruosa. A razão pela qual eu já comprei TRÊS VEZES fones da JBL ao longo dos últimos três anos é que, em todos esses casos, passados alguns meses, a bateria se suicida, ou então o fone não liga, ou qualquer erro aleatório começa a dinamitar a possibilidade de utilizá-lo. Ou seja, tudo é lindo e maravilhoso, desde que você use pouco, porque a vida útil dele é ridiculamente curta.Não me levem a mal, se eu comprei três vezes é porque todo o resto é fantástico: o som grave é quase imperial, a bateria, quando ainda funciona, é colossal nesse 510 e muito acima da concorrência.Entretanto, é isso que eu preciso vir falar aqui: toda essa lua de mel funciona para quem usa pouco, para quem usa de forma intensiva, você esbarra claramente no limite da obsolescência programada do produto: míseros meses são o suficiente pro aparelho se suicidar, não querer ligar, a bateria pular de 50% pra 0% sem razão alguma, etc. Isso não deveria acontecer, haja vista que até celular dura muito mais do que isso sem ficar inutilizável. O que adianta  JBL fazer um fone fantástico se esse "fantástico" dura 5 meses? Este último foi a gota d\'água, foi a compra foi feita no dia 28 de janeiro de 2022 e esta desgraça já está ruim agora, no início de agosto. Até os produtos anteriores da marca tinham durado mais que isso. Enfim, essa é a situação dialética que os usuários tem de ser informados: sim, ele é ótimo, colossal, mas essa lua de mel tem uma vida útil muito reduzida. Antes eu pensava que era problema da unidade que eu comprei, algo de exceção, mas passadas três vezes que comprei o produto e em todas elas acontece isso, já vemos um padrão.\nRead more', '\nPuedo realizar una comparación de este modelo  JBL T760BTNC con\xa0\nSony WH-XB910N EXTRA BASS\n\xa0que también los tengo y pertenecen ambos a la misma gama de sonido. En general sin entrar en muchas especificaciones me han parecido unos buenos auriculares que al precio que están aquí en Amazon me parecen correctos y son una buena oferta en mi opinión no llegando a los 90 euros actualmente.Valorando la calidad que tiene la presentación y los propios auriculares en si, me parecen que llegan con una buena presentación y la calidad en general de los auriculares son de este tipo de gama, pesan muy poco, son muy cómodos y te atrapa toda la oreja por lo que la inmersión en el sonido está muy bien.La calidad que tiene las almohadillas me parecen mejores que los Sony de los que hablo, ya que estos, se me han deteriorado muy rápidamente, aunque existen recambios y se pueden cambiar fácilmente, algo que en los JBL desconozco por el momento si es posible.SONIDO.En cuanto al sonido en si, es cierto que tienen sonidos distintos, los JBL no tienen unos graves muy pronunciados, algo que se puede mejorar con un ecualizado por software pero el equilibrio que tiene me parece acertado para personas que no quieran tener siempre un zumbido en la cabeza con los graves, es decir equilibrio entre medios y agudos y bajos no muy altos, como he dicho se pueden mejorar con un software de ecualización. Aquí, personalmente, los Sony tienen más cuerpo en general, pensado quizás para una música que tenga unos bajos muy pronunciados, hip hop, pop, etc, sin embargo con música como metal personalmente los tengo que bajar por lo que creo que tienen un punto superior a estos JBL.CANCELACIÓN DE RUIDO.Ambos tienen un muy buen sistema de cancelación de sonido activa, excelentes aunque los JBL necesitan un punto más alto de volumen para sentirte totalmente aislado y creo que en este caso el sistema de Sony los supera, no por mucho, pero si en reducción.En ambos casos no escucho ruidos molestos ni sonidos demasiados agudos como me ocurre con otros Jabra que tengo, que nos lo comparo porque pertenecen a otra gama más elevada. En definitiva buena cancelación de sonido.SOFTWAREAquí es un punto que no entiendo, los JBL TUNE760NC no son compatibles con la aplicación JBL Headphones, no podemos por lo tanto ecualizarlos ni configurarlos a nuestro gusto, sin embargo los Sony WH-XB910N, si. No suele ser importante para personas que simplemente quieran unos auriculares para escuchar música, hablar por teléfono etc, pero para mi es un punto importante siendo de esta gama de auriculares.COMODIDAD.Son realmente cómodos, no pesan en absoluto y las almohadillas son blandas y por ahora no se deforman ni se están deteriorando. En la diadema superior no tiene ningún tipo de apoyo o aporte para poder amortiguar la presión, pero en general son muy cómodos.CONCLUSIÓN.Me han parecido unos buenos auriculares, dentro de la gama que estamos hablando lo esperado en sonido, quizás si buscas unos bajos potentes estos no sean los tuyos, si busca algo equilibrado puede ser una buena opción a tener en cuenta.Que no tenga soporte por aplicación es algo que no termina de gustarme personalmente, pero en general considero que al precio que los he comprado a la fecha de escribir esta opinión están bastante bien para usuario no muy exigentes los considero unos buenos auriculares. Para más exigentes hay que irse a otras gamas más elevadas.Espero que esta opinión te haya servido de ayuda,\nRead more', '\nO produto chegou antes do esperado, parabéns Total Express e Amazon!

Era apenas um probleminha de configuração, onde vc tem que restaurar a configuração para a de fábrica apertando (segurar o botão durante 30 segundos, mais ou menos) os botões + e - ao mesmo tempo até que a luz branca dele mude para cor azul e comece a piscar, pronto feito isso ele conectou em tudo!

Qualidade de som e microfone boas para uso cotidiano, o isolamento não é total, mas pra mim não é um problema.O material é excelente, super articulado e o tecido que recobre as almofadas é tipo um courino, fácil de limpar e após meses utilizando continua como se fosse novo. Uma simples limpeza com pano úmido e detergente neutro é o suficiente.Sofro com fones que apertam a cabeça, e este modelo não me causa dor. Consigo utilizar por horas a fio sem nenhum desconforto.A duração da bateria é absurdamente boa. Não é possível utilizar o fone enquanto carrega, mas tem a opção de utilizar um plugue de entrada 3mm que acompanha o fone. A recarga é super rápida.A conexão com outros aparelhos é simples, e consigo conectar a mais de um aparelho ao mesmo tempo. Utilizo com celular e notebook e eles alternam de forma automática à medida que um e outro emitem sons.Por último faço uma comparação com o fone modelo 510BT (também da JBL): este modelo 710BT é muito superior. O outro já está com cara de velho, qualidade de som inferior e aperta muito a cabeça e o tecido que recobre o fone é de qualidade inferior e difícil de limpar.Recomendo demais este modelo, compraria novamente de olhos fechados.\nRead more']}{'title': '        JBL Tune 720BT Wireless Over Ear Headphones with Mic, Pure Bass Sound, Upto 76 Hrs Playtime, Speedcharge, Dual Pairing, Customizable Bass with Headphones App, Lightweight, Bluetooth 5.3 (Black)       ', 'reviews': ['\nheadphone audio quality is good and is value for money the only complaint is its not over the ear as mentioned in product details it is on the ear\nRead more', '\nThe sound quality is amazing and clear.

Right earcup is having very less bass, sent it for warranty claim but they don't cover bass in the warranty.2. Ambient mode is also not working properly in right earcup and they also not solved this issue in warranty claim and rejected my claim.3. I use headphones for work and study but they did not meant for that, even you can't wear them for 1 hour they will cause a lot of pain in your head and around ear.4. ANC is pretty average for this price range, but comfort is  -10/5 Don't trust on YouTube reviews because i trusted on YouTube review and wasted my money.If you are thinking why i have not mentioned about sound quality i think sound quality doesn't matter when comfort is zero.My simple suggestion is if you are planning to buy over ear good ANC headphones save some more money and go for sony you will get good sony headphones under 10,000/-But don't go for this product.Update - They have finally replaced my product after 1.5 months of testing my patience.

The premium material and all as boasted in the review videos, well, a glossy hard plastic doesn't mean it's premium.However, I would give it to the hard plastic it used, the metal hinges and leather cup quality, it sure is durable compared with the other headphones.Sound:I may say it's average or not so good for someone who wants genuine sound. I mean it's too much manipulated for my ears to listen this muffed up sound no matter what mode or settings I play it on.Just annoying it is as it makes no sense of having a 40mm driver to listen the muffed up sound. It may take a while for me to adjust to this sound. An custom app or something could have made it a better experience to get a customized sound profile.Comfort:These are heavy. I don't have any comparison criteria but just 40 mins of wearing these, made my ear heated and sweaty.But didn't caused any pain of any sort which is a good things I guess.The battery and mic quality, well I have a long way to explore that aspect.

But this ain't bad.)+ Has 4 ANC modes in the HeyMelody app. Max Noise Cancellation, Noise cancellation, Off, and Transparency mode.The max noise cancellation mode gives pretty solid, usable active noise cancellation. Trust me it's good enough at this price range. It blocks out most of the outside noise to a great extent. Especially the noise like AC, fan etc in your room, traffic outside, these kind of noise will be reduced to a great extent. It will not be Sony xm4 xm5 levels of great. But under 5k this sounds good.Noise cancellation will be a 3 out of 5 in my opinion. The transparency mode does it's job but not that great.

You can use it full time with max noise cancellation without worrying about battery life.+ Fast charging is working fine.+ Build quality is pretty good. I got the matte black and it has a good in hand feel.+ Since it is a smooth curved design, it is easy to put in your jeans pockets. And has a small footprint+ The mic is decent and usable. Can be used for calls. Not too amazing.

Graves muito bons, agudos levemente sem brilho, mas é nos médios que o fone me decepciona. O som fica distorcido quando a música fica mais cheia. O som não tem uma boa definição, é "embolado". Se você curte mais rap e hip-hop talvez não perceba tanto porque os graves são bem interessantes. Mas pra quem curte rock, música eletrônica ou clássica, esquece, você vai ser decepcionar. Já pra ouvir podcast e assistir vídeos casualmente é tranquilo.CONFORTO: Eu esperava mais firmeza no aperto, pois já tive o 450bt e usava bastante pra correr, protegendo as orelhas do frio! Esse ainda serve, mas não fica tão firme. Mas se você só vai na academia, nunca vai perceber a diferença! Pode comprar.Não é um fone pra ficar muito tempo na cabeça. A haste acima da cabeça já começa a incomodar depois de uns 20 minutos. Mesmo assim é relativamente leve, prático e bonito pra sair na rua (não fica tão grande na cabeça).As espumas aquecem um pouco as orelhas depois de um tempo, que é justamente o que eu quero, mas eu sei que muita gente não gosta. Eles também descascam em pouco tempo, mas o bom é que são fáceis e baratas de trocar.DESIGN: os botões são simples e fáceis de achar sem olhar. O botão on/off é durinho e precisa segurar uns segundos, então você nunca vai desligar sem querer. É todo em plástico, não chama atenção, é discreto e simples.BATERIA: é ótima! Realmente é o destaque desse modelo. São realmente mais de 50 horas de uso. Muito bom.CONECTIVIDADE: é ótima. Consigo ouvir músicas, podcasts e participar de reuniões por toda a casa, sem problemas, mesmo com o celular ou computador longe no quarto. A opção de conectar em 2 dispositivos também é muito útil.MICROFONE: não é bom, mas só pra falar em algumas chamadas... quebra o galho.PREÇO: em comparação com outros fones da mesma faixa, esse JBL entrega mais qualidade do que a concorrência. Não é o melhor som, nem o mais confortável, mas é o mais equilibrado que se encontra na faixa dos ~250 reais.RECOMENDO!\nRead more', '\nJBL é JBL né! O fone é perfeito! Qualidade do som perfeita!

A duração da bateria é excelente, coloquei para carregar no dia em que chegou, utilizo somente para o treino, então são mais ou menos 5 dias por semana durante um período de 2h/2h30 por dia, e desde que comprei (há mais ou menos 2 meses) ainda não precisei carregar novamente.

The bass is robust, and the high frequencies, while slightly louder than my preference, still deliver a clear sound. Cymbal sounds are notably prominent, occasionally to the point of being loud. Across various music genres such as Rock, Jazz, Pop, Indian Classical, and Bollywood, the headphones performed admirably, except for rock music, which I found a bit harsh. However, this can be fine-tuned through the SOUNDCORE app, which provides built-in EQ presets and the option to create custom presets. Overall, considering the price point, these headphones offer exceptional audio quality.Design - 4/5The headphones sport an eye-catching design. Their fit and finish are commendable, although the buttons feel a bit clunky. On the other hand, the touch sensor is highly sensitive and responsive. The black and gold combination, especially the logo, exudes a premium aesthetic.Comfort - 4/5In terms of comfort, these headphones shine. You can wear them all day without any discomfort. The memory foam cushions are thick and plush, providing a comfortable experience for extended use.Battery - 4/5The battery life is excellent. Out of the box, the battery had a decent charge and lasted for more than 15 hours. A full charge is expected to yield an impressive 35-40 hours with ANC (Active Noise Cancellation) activated.Features - 3.5/5ANC performs adequately, effectively reducing external noise, but it falls short of greatness. Call quality was initially subpar, with low volume, which improved after charging and resetting the headphones. Bluetooth connectivity is swift, thanks to the fast-connect feature, ensuring a seamless connection as soon as Bluetooth is activated.VerdictIn conclusion, these headphones are a compelling choice at their price point.

Battery life is also good, you get a solid 40 hours of playtime on just 2 hours of charging.I’ve been a fan of Anker for a few years now, and of all the Anker products I own, the Q30 is definitely top of the list!\nRead more', '\nI HAVE BEEN USING SOUNDCORE HEADPHONES Q35 NOW AROUND A YEAR AND RECENTLY PURCHASED Q30, BOTH HEADPHONES OFFER CRISP & CRYSTAL CLEAR SOUND QUALITY WITH VERY IMPRESSIVE BASS AND BONUS FEATURE OF ADAPTIVE NOISE CANCELLING WHICH WORKS GREAT OUTDOORS.BATTERY LIFE IS ALSO VERY GOOD LASTS ALMOST AFTER 14 DAYS FOR REGULAR DAILY USE OF 2 HRS..WORTH EVERY PENNY.....\nRead more', '\nExplico cómo configurar el ecualizador y doy una valoración del producto.Calidad / Precio son lo mejor que hay en el mercado en relación a calidad del sonido y cancelación de ruido.Si quieres centrarte únicamente en la calidad del sonido, puede que haya algunos sin cancelación de ruido que sean mejores.Comento los aspectos generales: - Batería. Una maravilla. Aguantan muchísimo. Usándolos casi toda la tarde y parte de la mañana solamente los cargo 1 vez a la semana. Además, cargan rápido.- Comodidad. Otra maravilla. Las orejas no duelen porque quedan completamente cubiertas, y la diadema es más ancha que las habituales, así que no presiona tanto sobre la parte superior del cráneo, que a veces molesta también con otros cascos cuando llevas unas cuantas horas usándolos.- Cancelación de ruido. Es bastante bastante buena. Cancela mejor los sonidos agudos y medios que los graves, pero aún así hace un muy buen trabajo con los graves. En mi caso, muy aprovechados para poder estudiar cuando hay obras, vecinos molestos que no se callan, mi hermano que es flautista. Para poder darme un paseo completamente aislado. Y el resultado es muy muy bueno. Te quitan aproximadamente un 70 - 80 % del ruido ambiental. Y si les subes el volumen un poco, lo eliminas por completo.Son el punto fuerte de estos cascos. Yo la tengo siempre activa la cancelación de ruido (ANC). El modo normal consume algo menos de batería, pero ¿para qué te vas a comprar unos cascos con cancelación de ruido si luego no la usas?- Calidad del sonido. Si le he puesto un 4 en vez de 5 cinco a este apartado de la valoración es porque el usuario tiene que manipular un poco el producto. Me explico.Para poner a funcionar los cascos debes descargar la app de Soundcore. La configuración predeterminada es bastante mala y el sonido es pobre, por no decir otra cosa. Lo bueno es que la misma app tiene un ecualizador que te permite solucionar este problema.Basta ir a la personalización del ecualizador y darle al + (Crear perfil EQ).He probado las 10 configuraciones que hay por ahí rulando en la web (las subo todas al final del comentario por si alguien quiere probarlas) y como conclusión extraigo las siguientes 2 configuraciones:Iluminar-3.5 / 4 / 6 / 6 / 4.5 / 5 / 6 / 6Oscurecer-3.5 / 6 / 2. 5 / 3.5 / 2.5 / 6 / 6 / 4.5El perfil "Iluminar" es todoterreno. Lo puedes poner por defecto y funciona bien con casi cualquier tipo de canción. Si alguna canción te resulta muy estridente (porque de base ya tiene muchos agudos esa canción), puedes seleccionar el modo "Oscurecer", que las suaviza un poco.¿Cómo saber cuándo un medidor se encuentra en el punto 2.5 o -3.5 etc?El cursor de cada frecuencia funciona por redondeo, es decir, para seleccionar 2.5, empezamos a subir el cursor desde el 0. Conforme suba, marcará 1, luego 2 y así sucesivamente. ¿Cuándo paramos? En el punto exacto en el que pasa de 2 a 3, ese punto es 2.5Conforme subes el cursor, lo que hace es ir tomando valores 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4 (para todos estos valores, mostrará que vale 2) Como funciona por redondeo, cuando llega a 2.5 aparece el 3.De igual forma, si queremos el -3.5, vamos bajando desde el -3 y el primer punto en el que aparezca -4 será el -3.5De hecho es más fácil establecer una frecuencia en 2.5 que en 2. Para alcanzar un 2, será más o menos la mitad entre 2.5 y 3.5 o, simplemente, un poquillo más arriba que el 1.5Por si a alguien no le convencen esas configuraciones, aquí hay una recopilación de las configuraciones que hay rulando por ahí en foros, vídeos y demás. Aunque ya digo que después de mucho testear, me quedo con las dos que he puesto arriba (que son producto de modificar y juguetear con algunas de las de aquí abajo)1 / 3 / 2.5 / 2.5 / 3 / 3.5 / 2 / 2.5-6 / 4 / 4.5 / 4 / 2.5 / 6 / 2.5 / 2.5-3 / -2.5 / 3 / 3.5 / 4.5 / -2-6 / 6 / 2.5 / 2.5 / 1.5 / 3.5 / 0 / -2.5-4 / 3.5 / 6 / 6 / 4.5 / 5 / 4 / 6-6 / -1 / 2 / 0 / 1 / 3.5 / -1 / 0-3 / 2 / 4 / 5 / 5 / 4 / -3 / 0-5.5 / 3 / -1.5 / 5.5 / -2 / 3.5 / 4 / -6-1.5 / 4 / 3 / 3 / 2.5 / 4 / 4 / 4-5.5 / 3.5 / -1.5 / 5.5 / -2 / 3.5 / 2 / 0\nRead more', '\nMinha análise abaixo, O HYPE É REAL!Qualidade sonora:(NOTA 9.9)Vou explicar por que não é 10. Não é 10 por que o equalizador stock (padrão) que já vem no fone não é muito bom na minha opinião, pois destaca somente frequências graves e subgraves e anula todas as outras. Mas é possível corrigir isso pelo o aplicativo da soundcore, equalizando do seu jeito, pois com o uso do aplicativo isso é possível, outra razão é que em algumas músicas seu agudo fica bem forte ao ponto de incomodar, mas de toda maneira, também é possível regular isso por meio do equalizador. Gostei muito da qualidade sonora! graves, médios e agudos impecáveis! com destaque para os subgraves! (ATENÇÃO: Você só terá essa qualidade sonora com o ANC desativado)Modo de transparência(10):Amei esse modo, super útil e funciona muito bem, capta bem os sons externos, uso bastante para não ter que tirar o fone da cabeça, além de que é bem fácil ativá-lo e rápido, já que só basta tocar a concha direita do fone por 1s e já altera para o modo transparência.Duração da Bateria(10):Incrível! Dura bastante, serve bem para todo tipo de uso! bateria perfeita, não há reclamações quanto a isso.Design(8,5): Muito lindo, robusto, design mais minimalista e quase tudo de plástico, (com exceção do arco de metal) que mesmo sendo de plástico, ainda assim consegue dar um ar de fone Premium, realmente. Contudo, vi análises na internet que esse fone não é muito resistente quanto parece, de acordo com que ouvi falar, os fones em suas dobradiças depois de um médio tempo de uso começam a se quebrar, porém, vi uma maneira de resolver isso, e é simples, como vocês podem ver na foto, o fone acompanha uma case onde ele sempre está dobrado e encolhido, o que pode com médio prazo forçar as dobradiças do fone ao ponto de racharem e talvez quebrarem, por isso, eu sei que é um acessório, mas recomendo não guardar o fone sempre a case ou evitar dobra-lo muitas vezes, por que isso pode forçar e fazer ele quebrar as dobradiças. Por isso, cuidado, mas se você tiver zelo vale a pena pagar o preço por este fone, porque ele é muito incrível em som e em design, e é resistente o suficiente, só lembre-se de não forçar as dobradiças. Um adendo é que esse fone atrai marcas de dedo.Conchas de couro sintético(9,0):São muito confortáveis, dão um isolamento passivo já bastante suficiente para se isolar um pouco do mundo, enfim não tenho muito o que falar, elas realmente cobriram toda minha orelha com folga (tenho orelha pequena, contudo acho que ficará tudo bem se tiver orelhas maiores) e são bastante confortáveis e macias, muito boas mesmo, porém, infelizmente possuem problemas também, Por ser couro sintético, se o usuário não ter zelo, em menos de um ano já podem apresentar descascamento e aí seria necessário trocar, porém outros fones concorrentestambém apresentam esse problema, então não há como fugir disso, mas ainda assim, apresenta uma boa qualidade, muito boas mesmo.ANC(Cancelamento de ruídos)(7.0)Não gostei muito, é Ok, mas longe de ser ruim hein?, serve para alguns momentos como para assistir vídeos ou só se vc quiser se isolar mesmo, ele funciona e realmente te isola do ambiente, e vai atender a maioria dos usuários. Contudo, ao ouvir músicas com frequências mais graves, não gostei de uma caracterisica que o fone apresentou, pois pude notar que frequências mais agudas e graves ficam  mais apagadas, apesar que a qualidade ainda se mantém muito boa,  isso ainda dá uma certa aparência de som menos encorpado.  Além disso, ao aumentar o volume perto do máximo ou no máximo, nota-se que o fone na tentativa de entregar graves, acaba por entregar um grave muito punch (Soco), e ainda mais é um punch distorcido e que me incomodou e por isso evito de usar o noise cancelling quando estou ouvindo música. No geral não gostei muito, mas era o esperado pela faixa de preço e sim, pelo o preço funciona muito bem, e se você gosta de ASMR esse fone é perfeito para tal, ou de estudar ou apenas se desligar mais do mundo.Aperto na cabeça (10)Ele não aperta muito na cabeça, somente o suficiente para o fone se manter preso na cabeça, e isso é fantástico! (na minha opinião) ele é diferente de outros fones concorrentes. É necessário um grande esforço para que ele caia de sua cabeça, então realmente muito bom!Adendos:1.O fone treme na cabeça, se você não gosta disso, talvez não queira este fone, (mas é normal para fones desse tamanho isso ocorrer), porém em minha experiência achei isso muito bom, dá uma maior imersão no áudio.2.Sobre o áudio p2 é bom mas fica com volume ligeiramente inferior ao bluetooth. E infelizmente as funções no modo P2 de noise cancelling, equalizador, dentre outros ficam indisponíveis, uma vez que o fone fica totalmente desligado quando isto é usado.3.Para realizar chamadas eu gostei bastante do áudio, bem alto e de boa definição, sendo bem bom para realizar reuniões no zoom, meet e dentre outros programas.4.Os Codecs desse fone são: SBC, AAC + HD AUDIO, o que é muito bom, pois vários fones adotam o SBC, que só entrega uma qualidade mediana, mas que também não é ruim. Já o ACC é utilizado em Iphones por exemplo e funciona muito bem por aqui, a qualidade é superior de áudio, e por incrível que pareça para jogos funciona muito bem, o seu delay em minha experiência foi até que melhor que o esperado, mas, pode ser ruim para alguns usuários, pois esse fone não oferece nenhuma função de diminuição de Delay para jogos, pois ele não foi feito para esse público.4.O bluetooth adotado aqui é 5.0, muito bom e com boa estabilidade, não tive problemas5. Seus botões são muito bons, rapidamente você é capaz de se acostumar, e funcionam bem para as funções que lhe foram designadas.6. Em relação ao atendimento ao cliente da OCTO SHOP BR, amei muito, pois todas minhas dúvidas foram respondidas rapidamente e eles procuraram me ajudar o máximo possível! muito obrigado pelo o incrível atendimento, e em relação aos correios, vai depender da sua sorte, mas comigo veio antes do prazo e tudo certinho, sem a caixa estar amassada nem nada, além de que não há necessidade de se preucupar com taxação, já que a própria loja já cuida disso.Resumo: Enfim, recomendo este fone sim com toda certeza de olhos fechados, tem seus problemas como qualquer coisa na vida, mas é muito bom mesmo, mais do que recomendado, O HYPE É REAL!É isso espero ter ajudado alguém a comprar ou a não comprar este fone.\nRead more', '\nEs difícil encontrar un auricular hoy día la verdad. Mil reviews (muchas de ellas pagadas con el producto gratis), y mil modelos tanto de bluetooth como de cable.En el audio el más dinero suele ir relacionado con el mejor calidad. Por eso si no podemos en ese momento o no nos apetece comprar algo demasiado caro, la amplitud de modelos a elegir no se reduce.Esta reseña parte de la base de que un auricular bluetooth jamás nos dará la calidad de audio de uno con cable por muy bueno o avanzado que sea el codec que utilice. En base a eso, en Internet hay un modelo en el que la mayoría de los compradores (o reseñadores de pago) están de acuerdo, Soundcore Life Q30.Después de la tralla que os he dado, al turrón, puntualizaré lo que quiero destacar:- Audio, graves, muchísimos graves. Olvidaos de la respuesta plana (cosa que yo prefiero y me encanta) o de predominancia de agudos. Soundcore le da mucha presencia de graves a este modelo sea el perfil que sea el que elijamos en la ecualización. Por supuesto indagando un poco por la red encontraremos la ecualización perfecta para obtener un sonido HiFi (con las diferencia existentes al no tener codec LDAC el cual sólo está en su hermano mayor de 100€, el Q35). La pongo al final de la reseña. Es por ello que evitad los comentarios en los que ponen pegas al producto por su graves. Se pueden reducir muchísimo y una de las gracias que tiene el producto es la personalización en su sonido. ¿Y por qué me quedo con el modelo si hay que afinar tanto la ecualización? Seguid leyendo.- Ecualizador, como comenté antes, gracias a él mismo podemos aumentar agudos, hacer más plano el sonido, potenciar graves (más aún de como vienen de fábrica), etc, una virguería.- Cancelación de sonido. Las cosas claras, no son los Sony XM3 o XM4, que no os engañen, pero por 59.95€ no existe nada igual en el mercado. El ANC funciona sorprendentemente bien y con gran calidad respecto al audio, por lo que no lo empeora.- Comodidad, todos los auriculares de diadema meten calor en la orejas, ya sea por la piel sintética o por la tela si es el caso. En verano todos nos dará calor, en invierno lógicamente menos. Una vez obviado esto las espumas parecen foam blandito que se adaptan a la cabeza super bien y no te enteras apenas que los llevas puesto, un 10 por el fabricante la verdad.- Bolsa de almacenaje, aquí no me ha gustado nada lo que ha hecho Soundcore. En las reviews del producto venía una bolsa distinta a la que están dando ahora. Antes tenía la forma de los auriculares en una especie de foam y con un bolsillo para los cables, ahora (ved foto adjunta) no es así y no hay bolsillo para los cables sino un bolsito que se cierra. Muy mal, de hecho les he escrito para comentarles el detalle, a ver qué me dicen.- Cable, el audio por cable es normalito, no son unos Audio Technica ni unos Beyerdynamics, da tanta calidad como por bluetooth pero sólo ellos lo saben, en la última actualización 2.30 se han cargado el ANC con la conexión cableada. Espero que lo solucionen.En resumen, no hay nada mejor por 60 euros, así de simple. Puedes probar 100 marcas, pero es que ni los Sony bluetooth de 30/50 euros se acercan a la personalización de sonido o al ANC que tienen los Q30. Reconozco que me desencanté mucho al ponerlos en funcionamiento y ver tantos graves, pero cuando consigues ecualizarlos, son una delicia. Y si a alguien le cabe duda, SÍ, el auricular lo compré de mi bolsillo 100%.NOTA: La ecualización la podéis poner así = -6, +5, +4, +2, +2, +6, 0, +1\nRead more', '\nBuena calidad de construcción, almohadillas cómodas pero de espuma de poca densidad lo que repercute en un aislamiento pasivo del ruido mejorable. La diadema és ancha, yo tengo un cabezón y no me aprieta nada, preferiría que el ajuste fuera más firme, aunque va a gustos.La aplicación muy bien, permite actualizar firmware, elegir ecualizador, crear uno a tu gusto y está la función de escuchar sonidos relajantes de la naturaleza, con o son anc, muy buena idea.El sonido és bueno por el precio, con cuerpo. Tienes muchas opciones de ecualización pre-fijadas si bien yo funciono con las que he creado yo, a mi gusto. Recomiendo ésta última opción para tener un sonido adaptado a tu gusto.Respecto a la cancelación de sonido, decir 2 cosas.La 1a que és flojilla, no cancela mucho aunque de notarse se nota,pero poca cosa, no entiendo las muchas reviews que dicen que es tan buena... claro que por el precio no podemos ir de tiquis-miquis.La 2a cosa y , lo que más me ha decepcionado de este auricular, és que el sonido con el anc conectado és malo. El campo se estrecha un mundo, suena como si escucharas a través de un tubo, el sonido se transforma a peor por lo que mejor escucharlo con el anc desconectado, mucho mejor.Me daré unos dias más para darle rodaje y ver que tal, si no mejoran los devolveré. No tiene sentido que unos auriculares con anc y buen sonido, se vuelvan malos una vez conectas el anc.Addenda1.Después de 2 dias de uso intensivo puedo matizar el problema con el anc. Hay un problema de software , que no sé si afecta a todos, o a un lote de auriculares en particular, ya que he visto reviews de otros usuarios que les sucede lo mismo. El tema es que cuando cambias entre los modos anc de ‘interior’ _‘exterior’ se escucha el sonido mal, como a lata. Por ejemplo,  si estás en el modo ‘interior’ de la anc y pasas a ‘exterior’ el sonido se vuelve pésimo,  O al activar la anc desde el modo normal que suena a lata. O si estás en anc i la quitas volviendo al modo normal, se escucha a lata unos segundos y luego por sí solo y sin tocar nada vuelve a oirse bien.En resumen, hay fallos de sonido en la transición entre modos anc i al activar el anc. Espero lo solucionen en la próxima actualización de firmware, sinó los devolveré.Addenda 2Después de contactar con el servicio técnico y decirme que pruebe a reiniciar los auriculares o que lo vincule a otro móvil, me sigue pasando el mismo error. Devueltos.Addenda 3Después de lo sucedido, el servicio técnico me envió otro auricular de prueba pudiendo verificar que los anteriores me vinieron defectuosos. Ahora se escuchan estupendamente (por el precio) y no dan ningún tipo de problema cuando cambio entre tipos de cancelación de ruido. Gracias por la excelencia del servicio post-venta, un 10. Ahora sí puedo recomendarlos honestamente.\nRead more', "\nImballo e tempi di spedizione come tradizione Amazon. Le mie cuffie ordinate la sera sono arrivate la mattina del giorno dopo. Esperienza d'uso completamente soddisfatto. Funzionalità, occorre fare lamano ai tasti che sono piccoli ma ben disposti, solidi e con un feedback tattile ottimo. Comprate ad occhi shiusi, rapporto qualità/prezzo/prestazioni senza eguali.Se volete leggere nello specifico prestazioni, dati tecnici e consigli di uso, proseguite.La scatola di imballo, contiene una custodia semi-rigida in tessuto mesh del peso di gr 422 (cuffie ed accessori) con chiusura a zip con cuciture ricoperte da una fettuccia, una targhetta cucita sul bordo interno, con stilizzate le cuffie, indica in che posizione vanno rimesse a posto. Esternamente è cucina una cinghia ad anello per il trasporto (quindi non il solito sacchetto morbido in vellutino).All’interno della custodia sono presenti le cuffie gr 267 (fate una foto per capire come vanno rimesse a posto – oppure vedi foto allegata alla recensione, ovvero, l’archetto va appoggiato sul supporto in gomma presente nella custodia e non all’interno di esso). In un sacchettino di velluto, sono presenti cavo di ricarica di 60 cm da USB ad USB – C (senza spina che va comprata a parte oppure usate quella del vostro cellulare o tablet) ed cavo audio cm 128 con il jack da 3,5 mm per il collegamento senza bluetooth ad una entrata audio.L’archetto regolabile con scatti precisi, è in metallo e ben imbottito nella parte che poggia sulla testa. I padiglioni, con driver da 40 cm, sono di un materiale in simil-pelle traspirante e molto morbido, che poggia sulla testa circondando il padiglione, creando un effetto “ventosa” leggero e piacevole ed isolando in parte, meccanicamente, dai rumori esterni. Le cuffie sono stabili muovendo la testa e la regolazione dell’archetto è stabile.PADIGLIONE SINISTRO: sono presenti la presa USB – C per la ricarica, vicino al bottone di accensione (premere per accendere, tenere premuto per spegnere fino alla accensione di un led rosso) che serve anche per l’accoppiamento Bluetooth, tenere premuto qualche secondo, fino alla accensione di un led blu e bianco alternati, che avvisano della ricerca di dispositivi bluetooth nelle vicinanze, quando la luce blu sola lampeggia, indica che l’accoppiamento è eseguito con successo, ed il tasto per la funzione di “Cancellazione del Rumore” in tre modalità:TOTALE: tutti i rumori vengono cancellati.TRASPARENZA: si sentono i rumori esterni “captati” dai 4 microfoni presenti sulle cuffie, utile per sentire una persona che ci parla o mentre si passeggia per sentire le macchine.SPENTO: cancellazione passiva, ovvero i rumori si sentono volume ed udito permettendo.Poggiando un dispositivo NFC sulla parte esterna del padiglione sinistro, è possibile fare l’accoppiamento istantaneo senza usare la ricerca con il bluetooth.Ogni volta che viene premuto il tasto “CN” una voce in cuffia ci avvisa della modalità attivata.PADIGLIONE DESTRO: ci sono i bottoni del Volume Su e Volume Giù (per riconoscerlo ha un pallino in rilievo) che se premuti in maniera prolungata cambiano traccia andando avanti o indietro nell’elenco delle tracce, un terzo bottone con funzione Play/Pausa, se premuto in maniera prolungata, attiva l’Assistente Vocale, veramente funzionante. Infine vi è l’entrata per il cavo audio.Pigiando qualche secondo, sulla parte esterna del padiglione si attiva la funzione “Trasparenza” (ovvero, i microfoni della cuffia fanno sentire i rumori ambientali che ci circondano in cuffia), pigiando di nuovo si disattiva tornando alla impostazione precedentemente impostata. Una voce nella cuffia ci avvisa della modalità “Trasparenza Disattivata/Attivata”.Il tutto è accompagnato dalla applicazione “Soundcore Life Q30” scaricabile sul sito del produttore, per Android ed Apple.La applicazione permette di:- Equalizzare le cuffie con 22 Preset non sovra-scrivibili, ma modificabili e salvabili con altro nome, quindi in tutto 44 equalizzazioni possibili.- Funzione “Qualità del Sonno” con 11 suoni ambientali (pioggia, vento, suoni della montagna, etc) sovrapponibili ed equalizzabili nella loro sovrapposizione, ovvero un suono più forte e l’altro più delicato, con timer ed auto-spegnimento completamente personalizzabili. Utile per esempio quando ci si deve concentrare o quando ci si vuole rilassare per studiare o per leggere un bel libro.- “Rumore Bianco” sono dei preset di suoni creati da voi o dalla Comunity, eh già, perché con l’app ci si può collegare anche ad una comunity di persone che usano i prodotti Anker, (cuffie ed altro) con un forum dedicato per chiedere consigli.ATTENZIONE: se le cuffie vengono collegate con il cavo ad una fonte audio, il bluetooth si disattiva e la applicazione “Soundcore Life Q30” non può essere usata cosi come tutte le impostazioni dell’equalizzatore delle cuffie, dovrete quindi usare l’equalizzatore della periferica alla quale siete collegati tramite cavo ed il microfono della periferica alla quale siete collegati tramite cavo audio, per parlare.Le cuffie sono dotate di protocollo bluetooth 5 quindi, possono essere collegate contemporaneamente a due periferiche differenti contemporaneamente, posto che entrambe abbiano il bluetooth 5, ed ovviamente funzionerà una periferica alla volta. Quindi potete vedere un film sul pc e tenere collegato il cellulare e con le cuffie ascoltare e parlare nel caso di chiamata in arrivo sul cellulare.Nel caso l’accoppiamento con una periferica non funzionasse, tenete premuto il tasto di accensione e il tasto di Volume Su per resettarle fino a quando il led lampeggia ripetutamente rosso e blu. Non occorrerà rifare l’accoppiamento in altre periferiche già accoppiate, si resettano solo le cuffie.DATI TECNICI:- Silk Diaphragm Drivers da 40mm certificati Hi-Res Audio. Questo significa che le cuffie possono riprodurre l'intero spettro dell'Audio Hi-Res (assumendo che il file musicale che state ascoltando sia anch'esso Hi-Res), ovvero, superano le specifiche dei CD audio, e cioè 16 bit di profondità e 44,1 kHz di frequenza di campionamento.In genere l'orecchio umano può udire i suoni nell'intervallo di frequenza che va dai 20 Hz ai 20000 Hz, anche se molti adulti non sono in grado di sentire sopra i 16000 Hz avere un range più elevato  16Hz – 40kHz consiste in una qualità sonora veramente elevata, equiparabile solo con cuffie di ben altra fascia di prezzo.- Impedenza 16 Ω . Se collegate tramite cavo, la resa in frequenza, sarà più elevata rispetto a cuffie con impedenza maggiore, ad esempio 32 Ω come la maggior parte delle cuffie da studio. In parole semplici, se le cuffie le userete collegate tramite cavo audio con telefono e/o tablet quanto più l’impedenza è minore tanto meno sarà la corrente richiesta per funzionare e quindi necessiterete di meno volume per sentire le cuffie. Quindi con periferiche come cellulari e tablet il volume di ascolto sarà maggiore in quanto le cuffie necessiteranno di meno alimentazione.- Bluetooth 5.0 (range di 15 metri) quindi possibilità di connessione con due dispositivi contemporaneamente.- Digital Hybrid ANC, Multi-mode Noise Cancellation.- Possibilità di aggiornare il firmware delle cuffie se disponibile tramite la applicazione Soundcore.- Funzione Transparency, ovvero i microfoni sui padiglioni riproducono in cuffia i rumori ambientali sovrapposti alla sorgente audio che stiamo ascoltando.- supporto all’NFC, possibilità di accoppiare le cuffie a dispositivi provvisti di NFC. Non è possibile fare l’accoppiamento con NFC se le cuffie sono collegate tramite cavo.- 2 microfoni per le chiamate.- porta USB Type-C per la ricarica, che avviene in circa 2 ore,  ATTENZIONE quando sono in carica le cuffie non si possono usare neanche con il cavo. Per usarle con il  cavo occorre un minimo di ricarica, considerando che supporta la RICARICA VELOCE in solo 5 minuti di carica 4 ore di utilizzo, il problema non si pone.- batteria 720 mAh. 40 ore di riproduzione musicale con ANC attivato (60 ore con ANC disattivato).- Audio codec supportati SBC, AAC, i codec aptX non sono supportati quindi niente audio Flac, dovrete rivolgervi al modello superiore le Q35 ma ad altri costi.ATTENZIONESe utilizzate le cuffie in bluetooth, su di un pc per ascoltare dei video e contemporaneamente le avete collegate al telefono sempre in bluetooth, per rispondere alle chiamate, disabilitate il microfono del pc, altrimenti interferisce con il microfono delle cuffie ed in chiamata avrete un fastidioso eco di ritorno. Contemporaneamente, abilitate sul pc le cuffie come solo audio (icona delle cuffie senza il microfono) perché le cuffie collegate come “hand set” (icona cuffie con microfono) hanno un suono mono che viene riprodotto uguale in entrambi i padiglioni, quindi niente effetto stereo.Se usate il pc sia per video-chiamate ed fruizione video e musica e siete collegati anche con il telefono (a meno di non convivere con il ritorno eco in cuffia), abilitate nella scheda audio del pc le cuffie come periferica audio e voce, (icona con le cuffie e microfono) ed anche come periferica audio e disabilitate il microfono del pc. Al contempo abilitate le cuffie sul telefono come auricolare, non come “handset”. Potrete ascoltare sul pc la musica o i video in stereo e parlare tramite le cuffie quando riceverete una telefonata video sul pc e potrete rispondere ad una chiamata sul cellulare ascoltando la chiamata in cuffia e parlando nel microfono del cellulare.ATTENZIONE:Se collegate le cuffie tramite cavo, potrete collegarvi ad una sola periferica, il bluetooth si spegne e così anche i microfoni delle cuffie, dovrete quindi usare il microfono della periferica alla quale siete collegati tramite cavo.Preferite il cavo se siete amanti del buon suono ma il Bluetooth va più che bene in ogni altro caso.Se avete altri dubbi, sul sito del produttore troverete dei video di istruzioni per ogni funzione delle cuffie ed un forum con una comunity molto vasta per porre qualsiasi quesito attinente alle cuffie.\nRead more"]}{'title': '        Sony WH-CH520, Wireless On-Ear Bluetooth Headphones with Mic, Upto 50 Hours Playtime, DSEE Upscale, Multipoint Connectivity/Dual Pairing,Voice Assistant App Support for Mobile Phones (Blue)       ', 'reviews': ["\nIt's all good good battery life for those who are facing connectivity issue to connect to other devices while turning on the headphones hold the button for 10 sec it will go in pairing mode and it'll connect️\nRead more", '\nheadphone quality is very good but not so easy in terms of context switching between the 2 devices\nRead more', '\nI am quite satisfied with this.No disturbance etc.Sound is very clear ,and comfortable to ears  also.But I found only  one difficulty.That is not with the product,but about registering  it for warranty ,the  serial number etc.is  not  written in clear way .Therefore  it is difficult  to write them  on  their website.It is good for making calls also ( both for hearing and  speaking )\nRead more', "\namazing product! i mean its sony, top notch sound quality and amazing build quality. they're really comfortable and with the app, the sound quality gets elevated. loved them.\nRead more", '\nMic is not so great .

I used it for a couple hours (1-3hrs) between classes, though I didn't use these headphones everyday so that may be why it lasted for a month. Nothing about these headphones has really changed. Sound still sounds bomb and I got used to where the buttons are for the headphones (which was a drawback I said about these previously). The app connected with the headphones works great and bluetooth still works fine, no random disconnects. Still agree with everything I said in my previous update!UPDATE (Sept 30, 2023): So it's been about a month of usage and the battery life is absolutely insane. I haven't charged it since the day I got it (Sept 4, 2023) and it's been a blast. These headphones are pretty durable. I can confidently throw them in my bookbag and not have to worry it might get damaged. I also don't have any issues with the headphones getting dirty easily (specifically the white version) if that's a concern you may have. Sound leaking is still apparent, I always have to be conscious about my volume being too high or not in a quiet room which is still something I can't get used to. I noticed the more I used the headphones, the less tension it caused for my ears and the more my ears started to adjust to them. I think at first your ears may feel tight, but after awhile it kinda gets used to it and hurts less, at least, that's how it was for me. Headphones are still going strong and still look brand new. 100% would recommendORIGINAL REVIEW (Sept 4, 2023):To address the other reviews I've been seeing, here's what I've come to terms with:WHAT I LIKED:- Very sleek and minimalist. I live for the design, I think it's a great and very aesthetically pleasing.- You have the option of changing the EQ setting (I changed it so bass can be more and they sound great even without tweaking the settings. Big fan of this feature as this is my first time ever being able to control the EQ settings)- Connects easily once you get through the app process + Bluetooth connection is pretty good, doesn't disconnect randomly.- Sound is good for me. Not very headphone savvy, but I can feel the beat of my music and that's always an A in my books.- Good PASSIVE noise cancelling, these definitely aren't active noise cancelling, but the padding does make your surroundings a little bit muffled so you don't hear as much. Which is fine with me since I'm planning to go to school with these and need to hear my surroundings most of the time.- Doesn't bother my earrings, don't even notice they're there.- Good battery life, nothing to complain about. Works throughout the day and can usually take on a few more days, which I find to be pretty impressive.- like that it's lightweight, I can put it around my neck without it being bothersome for long periods of time and while walking with them on, I don't feel like there's a weight on my head.WHAT I NOTICED/OTHERS MAY FIND BOTHERSOME:- In terms of sound leaking, these DO leak. they leak if you go past 50% or higher. This isn't an issue for me since the sound is already pretty loud at 20-30%, but considering those who love to blast music, it may be an issue.- hurts your ears when wearing it for too long.- these do NOT fold. Might be kind of inconvenient if you want to travel a lot with these, though, there are cases to store these specific headphones so it might not be so much of a problem.- the volume up/down and pause buttons are hard to differentiate between. They all kinda feel the same when wearing the headphones and although it's not a big deal to me, it could be inconvenient and frustrating to others.Haven't tested out calling abilities or connecting w/ 2 devices at the same time, but the things I said above were the things I noticed when I first unboxed and tested them. In my opinion, I think these are great, they work for me, and I like them. Gave it a 4 stars due to all the factors I noticed that may be a hindrance to myself and/or others when wearing these headphones. Otherwise, I think these headphones are worth a try. 9/10 for me\nRead more", '\nDesde que vi estos audífonos estaba cazando una buena oferta para comprarlos, pero casi no bajaban mucho. Los encontré de oferta en Amazon Estados Unidos a sólo $688 pesos. No pensé más y los compré, me gustaran o no, estaban a excelente precio.En cuanto a los audífonos, me sorprendieron bastante, ya llevo 3 días dándoles un uso continuo y me encanta como suenan.Los he usado mientras camino, en el trabajo y relajándome en mi habitación. Personalmente creo que para sacarles el máximo provecho debes utilizar la aplicación, las configuraciones de audio se adaptan a diferentes gustos.Cuando camino, si se escucha un poco del ruido afuera pero no del todo, para mi es bueno para estar atento.Los usé sin parar en mi trabajo, casi 6 horas, aunque tuve unos cuantos descansos. Si lastiman un poco después de mucho tiempo, pero no tanto como para sentir algún ardor en las orejas.Les daré un valioso consejo, yo compré la licencia de Dolby Atmos para Xbox, porque juego videojuegos. En la computadora, pude configurar de inmediato los audífonos con la App de Dolby y sin duda le dan un plus excelente, siento que se escucha mejor que la app del celular.Como contras yo diría que son un poco plásticos, quizá un mal uso los puede hacer romperse, pero también sirve mucho para no sentir tanto peso a la hora de hacer cualquier actividad, sobre todo hacer ejercicio.

It really ought be there at $60, even if they opted not to include a cable for it.No physical battery indicator- On startup the there is a voice prompt that gives a battery life approximation, though you will likely miss this if you turn the headphones on before putting them on your head as I do. Otherwise you need to use the app to see the exact battery percentage.These should probably only be used on a phone, due to increased latency with PC use and the lack of an audio jack. However, the former is what I was primarily looking for. For my purposes, I prefer these over a much more expensive pair of Sony XM4's I tried and returned.It's a shame that these have a solid expiration date when the battery stops holding a charge.

They are perfect for people like me who are working from home. These are the features i really liked:ANC: Excellent at removing background noise, which blocks all distractions. I have traveled in the metro with these on and my ANC experience was pretty good.Battery life: With 30 hours (ANC off) or 25 Hours ( ANC on), These headphones will keep going for days before they need to be charged again. In case you run out of battery, a quick charge of 15 minutes gives you additional 2 hours of playtime. Another option is the included 3.5mm stereo jack which you can connect between the headphones and your phone- which help you keep going even if you don't have a chance to recharge the battery.Comfort: Over-ear form factor is great, because it doesn't put pressure on my ears. When i took them out of the packaging, i was actually surprised to feel how light they were compared to other ANC models i checked in the market. The ear cushions are also really soft, which makes them super comfortable to wear for long hours.MIC clarity: Every call i attend has been crystal clear. I have not had any issues like repeating myself because the other person could not understand what I said.Connectivity: Paiting is really quick. It happens as soon as bluetooth is enabled. I keeps my headphones connected to my laptop and phone at the same time, which gives me the convenience of switching between them whenever i need to. This saves me the headache of disconnecting and reconnecting with my second device which is actually tedious and annoying.Storage: The headphones fold flat, and also compact so it makes carrying them around in a backpack, or laptop bag very easy. They also give a soft pouch, which protects them and prevents them from getting damaged.Bottom line: Just go for it, you will love these headphones.

Popped a battery in and played games, edited videos and scrolled the web. Playing games felt snappy and every click felt firm and responsive. The refresh rate of the sensor is top notch. It took me from gold to diamond in Valorant because of how responsive and precise you can aim with the mouse shape and the pristine sensor. It was all fun until I had to change the battery after just 1 month of use. Keep in mind, I was using a Logitech mouse before this, and that mouse lasted more than a year with one battery.But I guess its justified by the response time and it being a gaming mouse so it must be a power-hungry mouse. Fast forward one year, the clicks are as pristine as the time I bought it. All the buttons work well and it's still a beast. I took a break from gaming and stopped using my pc for a month because of work and when I came back to it, the mouse started malfunctioning.

Dalla prima volta che l'ho impugnato, ho potuto percepire la sua grande qualità e il suo design ergonomico si adatta in modo impeccabile alla mia mano, garantendo un comfort ottimale anche durante le sessioni di gioco più lunghe. Ricordo a tutti che questo mouse è particolarmente adatto ai destrosi, per i mancini ci sono altri mouse sempre marca Razer se avete scelto di acquistare un loro prodotto, come ad esempio il Viper, che hanno una impugnatura adatta a tutti.Precisione StraordinariaUna delle caratteristiche di questo mouse è la sua incredibile precisione. Ogni movimento viene rilevato con estrema accuratezza, offrendo una risposta fluida anche nei momenti più intensi del gioco. I pulsanti programmabili sono un vantaggio, consentendo di personalizzare completamente l'esperienza di gioco in base alle proprie preferenze.Costruzione RobustaLa solidità e la resistenza costruttiva sono evidenti sin dal primo tocco. Materiali di alta qualità conferiscono al mouse una sensazione di solidità. La rotella di scorrimento è precisa e reattiva, mentre i click dei pulsanti sono soddisfacenti. L'illuminazione personalizzabile aggiunge un tocco estetico al setup da gaming.Razer SynapseIl software Razer Synapse è altamente intuitivo e semplice da usare e consente di personalizzare completamente il mouse. Posso assegnare macro, regolare la sensibilità e creare profili personalizzati per diversi giochi. Ciò consente nel caso in cui si hanno altri prodotti Razer di abbinare i colori led o creare un interessante schema di colori.ConclusioneNon posso che consigliare vivamente il mouse Razer DeathAdder V2, anche se di una versione ormai passata, a tutti gli appassionati di gaming che vogliono puntare sulla realizzazione di un setup di fascia medio alta.

Et que la fonction hypershift (qui permet d'assigner a chaque bouton un autre clic est dérisoire vu le peu de boutons a configurer). Cette fonction n'a d'intérêt que sur des souris avec beaucoup de boutons.J'ai choisi cette souris pour les 8k polling rate... je sens clairement une différence par rapport aux 1k des autres souris de la marque. Et avec les souris de marque random, c'est un autre univers.Les 30k dpi sont pour moi de la poudre aux yeux car passé 3k dpi, c'est incontrôlable pour l'utilisation que j'en ai.Mon seul regret est qu'elle n'ait pas plus de boutons au pouce comme la Naga.

The best I had is the redragon mouse. I will still consider the redragon mouse as best in terms of  the softness in clicking any button. After 4 years of using my redragon mouse (still no issues) I feel to change my mouse to test the additional fire button that I dont have in my older mouse.These are the pros I found after playing Apex for 3 hours.1. All buttons are very clicky and you will feel good to press each button. Except the scroll button click which is a little hard to press comparing my redragon mouse. (A con) I got used to it now.2. All the side buttons can be identifiable while touching them and you dont need to see those. A very good feature which is ignored by many Big brands.3. All buttons are programmable using the software. In the box you will have a card specifying the url to download the kreo software.4. I kept the fire button as default and believe me, pistols and all single fire weapons (like g7 scout) are fun to play. There is a bug I noticed. Using the software if you change the fire button and again set it, then there is a issue with rapid fire. Make sure you set the default settings for this and change other settings but not the repid fire one5. Set any colour based on your setup. RGB looks awesome. Support many pre configured RGB thems like waves, breathing and many more along with single static color. And its true RGB.6. This supports 1000 hz polling rate and I have tested using 3rd party software.7. There are many other features on the software which I haven't tested. In one word you have full control on your mouse.8. There is a small button at the base of this mouse and you can customize it too. I kept it to change the RGB.9. Mouse texture feels very comfortable in hand.10. Braided cable and very good quality.11. Good gaming sensor(PMW 3327). I haven't feel any mouse movement glitches. It is not the best but great if you compare with a generic sensor.12. Two kreo hawk stickers are provided on the box.13. You can set dpi from 200 to 12000 range and unlike many brands you can set any value multiply by 100. Means you can set 200, 300, 400 and so on till 12000.Now lets discuss the cons I have faced -1. Scroll button is a little hard. I have replaced my first kreo hawk mouse as the first delivered mouse had a supsr hard scroll button. Replacement had a better scroll button click. But still harder than my redragon mouse. Make sure to test your mouse and replace if needed.2. The ergonomics is good for bigger hands only. If you have small hand you may ignore this design.3. Provided cable length is very short. If you have your system far away than its not a good option. My redragon mouse have very long usb cable.4. In some static RGB colour you will feel gaps in light if you look closely.5. Delivery time is more in Kolkata location. Its coming from Bangalore location.6. Not sure of any after sales support. I have send them an email 2 weeks back and still no reply. So be careful.My own final conclusion -I have purchased this for around 1140 and I had to replace the first mouse. Comparing the price it is definitely a very good option. I have to adjust myself with the scroll button click.1 star less as it needs some improvements mentioned in the cons.Thanks for reading!!!!

Does NOT affect accuracy in use3) Comes in a hard plastic box. Cool, but amazon may not cushion it properly for shipping.----Key Points of Comparison between M719, M711, and the M711-FPS:01) M719 and M711: share same mid-range button switches and mid-range sensor.02) M719 and M711: RGB can be turned of entirely.03) M719 and M711: Software is optional, most of features can be operated with buttons.04) M719 and M711: Onboard memory for all settings, remembers between restarts, diff computers.05) M719 moves a button to the left front as the "Rapid Fire / Sniper" Button.06) M711 has center-line sensor placement, while M719 is offset 1 cm to right.07) RGB is better on the M711 design, 2 more modes, and little more vibrant08) M711-FPS is same shell and RGB as the M711, but has top of the line sensor09) M711-FPS also feature optical button switches that are rated 50-million clicks10) M719/M711 hoped to be good for ~5yrs based on 10-million clicks button durability11) The M711-FPS can be reasonably expected to last 10+ years of casual useSo I would probably expect 5+ years of trouble free use out of the M719/M711.Double that price for 10+ years, plus a better sensor in the M711-FPS.Hope that\'s helpful in making a decision for the right mouse for you.====Continue for more details and explanations.Background for my Purchase:M719 Mouse was purchased to replace a Redragon M601 that\'s been indaily use for 3 years. Used for Productivity / Casual Gaming. The main buttonswitches were rated 5-million clicks, that rating in my case will lastabout 2.5 years of trouble-free use. Recently it began misclicking,misdragging/dropping items on the desktop. So it was time for a replacement.I like to value shop, so I set targets and then try to find best prices.Feature Goals of a replacement mouse, in order of importance:1) Durability. Good button lifespan rating for the price of the mouse.I paid ~$12.50 for a 5-million clicks mouse, and it lasted about 2.5 yrs.So I expect at least 5 yrs use from 10-million clicks buttons of a new $15 mouse.New upper range mice are 20-million clicks, and the super high end miceboast 50-million click omron switches for the main buttons.2) Optical Sensor. In general the current best mouse sensor is the PMW3360,or variants of it. That is only if you require the mouse to track while whippingit across a decent sized mouse pad and place very accurate clicks despitehigh accelerations and sudden movements. I don\'t play competitive games,so I just need a mid range sensor that is accurate and can be moved moderatelyquickly. Obviously if I can find a PMW3360 for a good price it would be even better.I prioritize button durability over sensor features, because in my experience,buttons wear out before sensors stop working. I know there are ways to DIY replacethe button switches, but most people would not do that for a budget mouse.3) Ergonomics. I want a commonly recognized shape that is comfortable. Obvious.4) Aesthetics. I prefer function over form when looking for a value mouse.So RGB is flashy, nice to have, but not a top concern. I also don\'t want acrazy looking mouse with overly aggressive design.----So with that, I found the feature set of the M719 very appealing on Cyber Monday.For under $15, it comes with:1) Omron switches rated for 10-million clicks - 2x my current mouse, so anticipate 5+ yrs use.2) Pixart PMW3325 mid-range sensor - much better than office mouse / current mouse3) Ergonomics that closely resembles the popular Logitech 203/G Pro series mice.4) Flashy RGB LED goodness that can mesmerize, and then quickly be turned OFF. :)5) All main features accessible via buttons. Settings remembered via onboard memory.Shape and Outer Shell:The mouse is small, low profile but not uncomfortably so. The Logitech ambidextrous shapeis popular for a reason. I use a fingertip grip, and typically move the mouse with pinkieand thumb - which works well for me.The hard plastic shell seem more refined than the M601. The top is a velvety matte finish,almost as if sand blasted, while the sides are hard plastic with polygonal textures.Good thing about the matte finish is that it feels nice, and is not the spray-on "soft rubber"that is often used in cheap electronics and melts to a sticky gooey mess after a few years.A potential down-side is that matte plastic scratches easily, and with wear, I wouldanticipate "bald" shiny spots over time.Buttons:Compared to the M601, I found the main buttons responsive. The LMB and RMB are easyto click, but because I tend to place my finger tips closer to the hinge area,they are stiffer for me than the M601 (which has a hinge further towards the backof the mouse). If your finger tips reach more towards the front, then they clickjust as easily. I\'ve adjusted to this difference after a few hours use.Side buttons are better and have less loose dead travel than on the M601.The two mode buttons for DPI and RGB are both smooth, and can be difficult todistinguish without looking. The DPI cycles as you\'d expect; the RGB cycle includes5 light modes and a OFF mode. - no light strip/logoThere is an additional button on the left side, forward of the two side button.Actually difficult to reach, but perhaps easier for someone with larger hands.By default, one click of it sends LMB x3 to the computer at 10ms intervals.Bonus features of the M719.Software NOT required:Great majority of the features can be operated from the buttons on the mouse,there is NO absolute need to install software to get the mouse working. PresetDPI settings are quite adequate for single 1080p and 1440p screen sizes. The softwareis generally intuitive, and has more features than most would need. With the software,all the buttons can be reset to any of the available functions for buttons.The scroll wheel can also be assigned some appropriate functions if desired.RGB lighting modes can be cycled with the RGB button, or button set to \'RGB Mode Cycle\'.Breathing (BREATHE) - light on, then gradual fade out.Rainbow (RAINBOW) - shifting solid color, one color at a time, and cycles.Full lighted (SOLID) - basically single steady color.Wave (WAVE) - is a multi-color spectrum across the mouse all at once, moves like rippleFlashing (FLASH) - is like like your car hazard blinkers** However, must note that there are only FIVE (5) RGB modes, and not theSIX (6) described in the manual. ( BREATHE / RAINBOW / SOLID / WAVE / FLASH )and a (LED OFF) mode. Manual says there is a "Go Without Trace" mode,but cycling via the button, and also using the software confirms thatthis mode does not exist.This review is way too long already.I had intended to add more comments on the software. But you can downloadthe specific software and look at the way it is set up, even without themouse. So I\'ll just say it was better than expected. Lighting setting arereflected between software and mouse immediately (set by button on mouse,or via onscreen tabs). DPI settings are not updated as intuitively, buteasy to work out.If the software does not seem to work, make sure you reboot/restart afterinitial installation - especially if you have other mouse software active.I will probably uninstall the software after a while, not because it is bad,but because I doubt I will need all the features it provides. I like asmaller less complicated system.Details on Omron switch superiority can be easily found via Internet search.Pixart PMW3325 features and evaluation can also be found likewise.Hope above provides enough data to make informed purchase decisions.I found the above features to be a good value for the price it was offered.Originally purchased on Cyber Monday, but I think the shipping wasa bit rough, and the mouse arrived DOA. Amazon.com would not allowa replacement so I ended up re-ordering it. Price differences areexpected to be clear up in the end by Amazon.LTC provided replacement quickly without additional costs.Hope above is helpful. Appreciate LTC Customer Service for sorting out order issues.Thanks for reading.\nRead more', '\nEste é o segundo mouse do mesmo modelo que eu compro, o primeiro eu peguei lá no longínquo ano de 2015.

Pretty much expected from Amazon prime.Onto the product itself, It arrived in a small box,Inside was a manual (Mostly warranty) and the mouse packaged in soft foam wrapper.The cable was very long and made of flexible rubber and there was a kink in the cable but since it\'s flexible I doubt it should be a problem. Black Matte finished mouse looks beautiful and feels very sturdy, No creaking of the plastics on the mouse of any sort and it\'s average sized so if you have small to medium sized hands it would fit snugly (I don\'t know about large sized but it looks big enough I believe) but I must mention that there is no rubberized grips of any sort on either side of the mouse it\'s all matte plastic and they have slick feet rubber only on the bottom for easy gliding of the mouse. The RGB lighting is the cherry on top (It\'s customizable :D). The G-HUB software from Logitech is pretty easy and straightforward when it comes to setting up the mouse but for the customization you can:A) Go with presetsB) Sit and struggle with the "create your own RGB" section..so it\'s upto our creativity but I\'m just lazy.Performance wise the mouse does very well.. I tested it for polling rate and it gave me a solid 1Ms polling rate and the dpi switching can be easily set-up to your requirements. Buttons feel very clicky and responsive and I found no issues with the weight..Tested it withFPS gamesSimulation gamesstory\'sand even worked on Documents.At 82grams you would not feel fatigued dragging the mouse around so this is arguably the most competitive mouse you can get at this price point..So If you got 1.6K to spare and it\'s even better if you get a sale on this product. I\'d say you can go for this product. This is also coming from someone who used Logitech products their entire life and I had a 1K worth Logitech G300s gaming for 3 years until the buttons gave away (Still works just needed to replace the button) So without a doubt go for it!

This is required for gamers and content creators alike (CounterGB in For Honor/Blender viewport panning) The wire of the mouse also is a little frayed where the wire meets the mouse. It's not used too rough, but it doesn't appear to be built to last for more than a year. My Dell MS3220 mouse is more durable than this. The comfort is a little tricky for me. I feel it should be a little shorter. The height from the bottom of the wrist to the top is a little too steep for my hand. Too often I've also accidentally hit the back/forward shortcut buttons unintentionally. I think it would've been great to have those buttons replace the DPI up/down buttons and keep the DPI change buttons below the mouse wheel instead like most other mice do.Apart from that, it's okay.

The best I had is the redragon mouse. I will still consider the redragon mouse as best in terms of  the softness in clicking any button. After 4 years of using my redragon mouse (still no issues) I feel to change my mouse to test the additional fire button that I dont have in my older mouse.These are the pros I found after playing Apex for 3 hours.1. All buttons are very clicky and you will feel good to press each button. Except the scroll button click which is a little hard to press comparing my redragon mouse. (A con) I got used to it now.2. All the side buttons can be identifiable while touching them and you dont need to see those. A very good feature which is ignored by many Big brands.3. All buttons are programmable using the software. In the box you will have a card specifying the url to download the kreo software.4. I kept the fire button as default and believe me, pistols and all single fire weapons (like g7 scout) are fun to play. There is a bug I noticed. Using the software if you change the fire button and again set it, then there is a issue with rapid fire. Make sure you set the default settings for this and change other settings but not the repid fire one5. Set any colour based on your setup. RGB looks awesome. Support many pre configured RGB thems like waves, breathing and many more along with single static color. And its true RGB.6. This supports 1000 hz polling rate and I have tested using 3rd party software.7. There are many other features on the software which I haven't tested. In one word you have full control on your mouse.8. There is a small button at the base of this mouse and you can customize it too. I kept it to change the RGB.9. Mouse texture feels very comfortable in hand.10. Braided cable and very good quality.11. Good gaming sensor(PMW 3327). I haven't feel any mouse movement glitches. It is not the best but great if you compare with a generic sensor.12. Two kreo hawk stickers are provided on the box.13. You can set dpi from 200 to 12000 range and unlike many brands you can set any value multiply by 100. Means you can set 200, 300, 400 and so on till 12000.Now lets discuss the cons I have faced -1. Scroll button is a little hard. I have replaced my first kreo hawk mouse as the first delivered mouse had a supsr hard scroll button. Replacement had a better scroll button click. But still harder than my redragon mouse. Make sure to test your mouse and replace if needed.2. The ergonomics is good for bigger hands only. If you have small hand you may ignore this design.3. Provided cable length is very short. If you have your system far away than its not a good option. My redragon mouse have very long usb cable.4. In some static RGB colour you will feel gaps in light if you look closely.5. Delivery time is more in Kolkata location. Its coming from Bangalore location.6. Not sure of any after sales support. I have send them an email 2 weeks back and still no reply. So be careful.My own final conclusion -I have purchased this for around 1140 and I had to replace the first mouse. Comparing the price it is definitely a very good option. I have to adjust myself with the scroll button click.1 star less as it needs some improvements mentioned in the cons.Thanks for reading!!!!

Popped a battery in and played games, edited videos and scrolled the web. Playing games felt snappy and every click felt firm and responsive. The refresh rate of the sensor is top notch. It took me from gold to diamond in Valorant because of how responsive and precise you can aim with the mouse shape and the pristine sensor. It was all fun until I had to change the battery after just 1 month of use. Keep in mind, I was using a Logitech mouse before this, and that mouse lasted more than a year with one battery.But I guess its justified by the response time and it being a gaming mouse so it must be a power-hungry mouse. Fast forward one year, the clicks are as pristine as the time I bought it. All the buttons work well and it's still a beast. I took a break from gaming and stopped using my pc for a month because of work and when I came back to it, the mouse started malfunctioning. Every time I lift the mouse the cursor starts spazzing, and I have no way to open up the mouse and clean it, will have to go the service center soon.

Dies war mein erstes Razerprodukt und auch meine erste Maus von einer richtigen Marke.Natürlich kann ich diese nun nicht mit High-End Produkten vergleichen. Jedoch bin ich mit der Qualität zufrieden, für den Preis passt das alles.Meine erste Maus ging nach ca. 1 Jahr täglicher Nutzung kaputt. Das Mausrad machte Sprünge und die linke Taste gab so langsam den Geist auf. Nach nur ca. einem Jahr ist das sehr ärgerlich und ich habe auch lange überlegt, ob ich mir die Maus nachkaufen soll, oder eine andere Option suche. Am Ende habe ich mich für das Nachkaufen entschieden. Ich hoffe einfach, dass ich einfach nur Pech hatte mit meiner alten Maus und, dass die Neue nun länger mitmacht.Die Maus ist relativ leicht aber für mein Geschmack nicht zu leicht. Sie liegt gut in der Hand, auch bei Personen mit großen Händen. Auf Tastendruck reagiert die Maus schnell, damit hatte ich noch kein Problem.Auch beim Gaming tut die Maus, was sie soll. Sie verzieht kaum und ist präzise. Für "Hobby Gamer" reicht das, was die Maus kann, aus.Zusammengefasst kann man also sagen: für Menschen, die eine relativ günstige Maus suchen, ist diese hier perfekt. Sie liegt gut in der Hand, sieht sehr schön aus und tut das, was man braucht. Fürs Gaming reicht diese Maus aus, wenn man nicht zu tief in die Tasche greifen möchte.\nRead more', "\nInizio subito dicendo che il mouse Razer DeathAdder V2 è un prodotto eccezionale in ogni aspetto, ma la mia valutazione di 4 stelle è a causa delle variazioni di prezzo che ha questo prodotto, essendo un prodotto ormai superato dalla versione 3. Dalla prima volta che l'ho impugnato, ho potuto percepire la sua grande qualità e il suo design ergonomico si adatta in modo impeccabile alla mia mano, garantendo un comfort ottimale anche durante le sessioni di gioco più lunghe. Ricordo a tutti che questo mouse è particolarmente adatto ai destrosi, per i mancini ci sono altri mouse sempre marca Razer se avete scelto di acquistare un loro prodotto, come ad esempio il Viper, che hanno una impugnatura adatta a tutti.Precisione StraordinariaUna delle caratteristiche di questo mouse è la sua incredibile precisione. Ogni movimento viene rilevato con estrema accuratezza, offrendo una risposta fluida anche nei momenti più intensi del gioco. I pulsanti programmabili sono un vantaggio, consentendo di personalizzare completamente l'esperienza di gioco in base alle proprie preferenze.Costruzione RobustaLa solidità e la resistenza costruttiva sono evidenti sin dal primo tocco. Materiali di alta qualità conferiscono al mouse una sensazione di solidità. La rotella di scorrimento è precisa e reattiva, mentre i click dei pulsanti sono soddisfacenti. L'illuminazione personalizzabile aggiunge un tocco estetico al setup da gaming.Razer SynapseIl software Razer Synapse è altamente intuitivo e semplice da usare e consente di personalizzare completamente il mouse. Posso assegnare macro, regolare la sensibilità e creare profili personalizzati per diversi giochi. Ciò consente nel caso in cui si hanno altri prodotti Razer di abbinare i colori led o creare un interessante schema di colori.ConclusioneNon posso che consigliare vivamente il mouse Razer DeathAdder V2, anche se di una versione ormai passata, a tutti gli appassionati di gaming che vogliono puntare sulla realizzazione di un setup di fascia medio alta. Le prestazioni eccezionali, la costruzione di alta qualità e le opzioni di personalizzazione avanzate lo rendono il compagno perfetto per ogni tipo di giocatore.Trovate l'offerta giusta e acquistate un piccolo gioiellino, io non potrei essere più soddisfatto del mio acquisto!\nRead more", "\nHad this mouse for a while now and have been playing all sorts on different consoles and pcs and at first I hated it the way it felt the way in how heavy it was but all of that just takes time the ergonomic shape makes it so my pinky and ring finger aren't levetated all hours while playing and with the smooth feel of the mouse provides a comfortable experience but this mouse does have down sides if your thinking about playing this on a xbox you at no avail can change the dpi I would go to play fortnite with the Mrs and have to put the sensitivity all the way up to 25 percent as out the box it's set to 450 dpi with no way of changing it on console and even if you do, do it on pc it still won't transfer same with macros it will read the mouse button as unusable so things to be careful about but after using this couldn't go back to my light mouse\nRead more", "\nMerci Razer, sincèrement j'avais vraiment du mal à me trouver une souris qui convenait à mes grosses mains, je suis passé par beaucoup de souris dont la fameuse logitech superlight (qui est superbe mais trop petite pour ma mains) et j'ai trouvé mon bonheur dans cette razer.Elle est belle, fluide, légère, seule déception c'est les patins de base qui sont bien sans plus et facilement remplaçable. (Pour le prix, on aimerait quand même quelques choses de parfait dès le début)Sinon, elle est incroyable, actuellement je joue avec sur un tapis X-Raypad aqua control plus et j'ai enfin trouvé mon combo parfait.En plus, en tant que gros fan de SKT, elle est VRAIMENT super belle et la peinture dessus tient super bien, la transpi ou l'humidité ne lui fera rien, en tout cas de mon côté c'est parfait.Je conseille même si le prix est quand même haut, elle est géniale.\nRead more", "\nLa souris est extrêmement légère. N'ayant pas l'habitude, c'est très surprenant.La longévité des matériaux ne pourra se faire que dans le temps.Niveau performances, le logiciel synapse de Razer se chargera des réglages de manière simple et efficace. Rien à signaler si ce n'est que le changement de DPI ne s'affiche pas toujours et demande parfois de fermer l'application et ses processus, puis être relancée pour que cela fonctionne. idem, le logiciel reconnait le clavier azerty en tant que qwerty, mais cela n'est que visuel. la bonne touche est prise en compte. Et que la fonction hypershift (qui permet d'assigner a chaque bouton un autre clic est dérisoire vu le peu de boutons a configurer). Cette fonction n'a d'intérêt que sur des souris avec beaucoup de boutons.J'ai choisi cette souris pour les 8k polling rate... je sens clairement une différence par rapport aux 1k des autres souris de la marque. Et avec les souris de marque random, c'est un autre univers.Les 30k dpi sont pour moi de la poudre aux yeux car passé 3k dpi, c'est incontrôlable pour l'utilisation que j'en ai.Mon seul regret est qu'elle n'ait pas plus de boutons au pouce comme la Naga. Et que ces deux boutons au pouce soient un peu sensibles (je clique parfois maladroitement sans le vouloir, mais sans doute une question d'habitude).Pas de rgb (pour savoir quel profil est utilisé).Bref, entièrement satisfait.\nRead more"]}{'title': '        Cosmic Byte Spectrum RGB Wired Gaming Mouse, 66grams, 12800DPI, 1000Hz Polling, 10M Switches, Software Support (Black)       ', 'reviews': ['\nBest budget mouse for gaming purpose this includes breaded cable which i like most\nRead more', "\nI received the product with damaged packaging but the product inside was in perfect condition.

The mouse's quality was above my expectations.The packaging was done quite well.Features:This mouse features 4 extra buttons (Two on the side and two behind the scroll wheel) other than the usual 3 buttons (Left, right and scroll click)The scroll wheel is pretty good too!There are 5 DPI modes.RGB Modes are customizable but there are some bugs in the software.The sensor on this mouse comes with a max poling rate of 125-130Hz which gets the job done in most games but for intense games it puts you in a disadvantage in the play. There are many other good mice, if you prefer higher poling rate like the Razer Deathadder Essential.This mouse comes with a normal USB-A pin and a braided cable.Others:This mouse is best for palm grip users, but for finger and claw grip users this could be an option but, there are other good mice out there.This mouse is well suitable to medium size hands.Few downsides that I found:I have medium sized hands. Due to the prensence of side buttons on the left side of the mouse, the area for the thumb decreases and sometimes results in misclicks during the usage. (While writing this review I reloaded the amazon page accidentally and all the progress was lost due to the side buttons)The poling rate is low, which is not suitable for everyone and every game.The mouse comes with a CD driver to install the mouse software. But, nowadays most laptops don't come with a CD slot. I had to visit their website for the drivers.Pros for Minecraft players:This mouse is great for PVP and bridging too!First of all, this mouse can DOUBLE CLICK though it has optical switches!This mouse can drag click (about 16-20 cps easily), Jitter click (10-12 cps) and butterfly click (15-18 cps) comfortably!Overall, I feel like this mouse is suitable for most games and work too.Hope this review helps, Cheers!\nRead more", '\nI am using this product for long timePros and consPros - This mouse has 7 keys and separate app for mouse it self which you can use to customize the mouse.Cons - you open app every time to use saved settings\nRead more', '\nExtremely comfy shape for hand DPI prescision is good for now, Plat 2 on valorant using only redgear A20You can go for this, good in segment : )\nRead more', "\nI didn't not expect that much.

It's very thin and lightweight and the curved edges make it very comfortable to hold on for longer periods.Also the glass sandwich built feels premium.Next coming to display, the 120 hz curved amoled panel is in one word, splendid. It offers an immersive viewing experience with buttery smooth output. It also supports up to 1300 nits of peak brightness which helps viewing in direct sunlight.Now, when you buy a IQOO device you don't have to worry about the performance. It shares the typical IQOO dna and is powered by MediaTek dimensity 7200. The processor is very capable in running daily tasks and graphic intensive games. I am not much of a hardcore gamer but so far what I have tested I'm impressed. Games like BGMI, COD, Genshin Impact runs smoothly in this device with good graphic settings. IQOO also has done a job in cooling the processor, it barely gets hot while gaming.Next coming to camera, it has a 64 megapixel rear sensor which offers very good photos in daylight as well as night time. And the 16 megapixel front sensor is good too. The rear sensor can do 4k 30fps video recording and the front is locked at 1080p 30fps. Now, I am not that much of a camera guy, watching a camera review of this device will surely give you a better idea.After that I would like to share my thoughts on the battery and charging department. I was a little concerned about the 4600mah battery capacity and the 120hz display combo but surprisingly the battery holds up pretty well. I get easily a whole day of usage with 6-7 hours of screen on time which also includes gaming. The 66w charging adaptor charges the device from 0 to 100 in about 55 minutes which I believe is pretty good.Coming to network and connectivity, I haven't really got the opportunity to test the 5G connectivity as my local area does no not have 5G network. But 4G plus career aggregation is very constant and it offers good uploading and downloading speeds.The last thing to talk is about software. The device comes with the latest Funtouch OS 13 based on Android 13 and IQOO has promised 2 years of OS and 3 years of security patches which is decent.Personally I don't like the Funtouch OS much. I am coming from OneUI and compared to that this OS feels a little bit less lively. The animations are fluid and it also has all the necessary features but it needs more polishing. Do note I haven't faced any bugs in the software but there are a few advertisements which you can turn off and then it becomes a  very clean experience. The software experience completely varies from user to user so you might not be bothered by it at well. I just hope the brand polishes their UI more.Coming to compromises, it only has three which in my case is not much of an issue. It has an avarage vibration motor which doesn't offer flagship like experience. This device comes with a mono speaker which is decent. I'm coming from a device with a single speaker so it doesn't bother me as such. Also instead of the 2mp macro sensor a telephoto or ultrawide angle lens would have been highly appreciated.In conclusion, it can be said that it is a very good overall package if you can get it at 22k with the card offers. But for 24k it could've been better. It misses a few corners which would have made it perfect under 25k.

The device is equipped with a versatile camera system that captures sharp and vibrant photos. With a high-resolution sensor and various shooting modes, it excels in both well-lit and low-light conditions. The device's image processing software enhances photos, delivering professional-grade results.Hanging Issues:Hanging or performance issues are minimal on the IQOO Z7 Pro, thanks to its powerful hardware configuration. The 8 GB of RAM ensures that the device can handle multiple apps and tasks simultaneously without slowing down. However, it's important to keep the device's software updated to maintain optimal performance and address any potential software-related hanging issues.Last Words - The IQOO Z7 Pro with 8 GB of RAM and 256 GB of ROM offers a compelling mobile experience. Its sound quality, ease of use, and image quality are top-notch. While hanging issues are generally well-managed, regular software updates are recommended to ensure a smooth and trouble-free user experience.\nRead more"]}{'title': "        HONOR 90 (Emerald Green, 8GB + 256GB) | India's First Eye Risk-Free Display | 200MP Main & 50MP Selfie Camera | Segment First Quad-Curved AMOLED Screen | Without Charger       ", 'reviews': ["\n\n\n\n\n                    The media could not be loaded.\n                \n\n\n\n\xa0I am using it for almost 30 days and these are my observations. It is highly overhyped phone by the HONOR marketing team.First let’s talk about the good things:PROS:1) GOOD DISPLAY: Most striking feature is the display. It has 1.5K resolution and very bright screen (no issue in outdoor use).2) GOOD CAMERA (Only in DAY time): It takes really decent pictures in daytime with the primary main camera as well as front camera. In low light it really sucks and useless. It doesn't have the OIS, getting shaky pictures if take pictures while moving or of moving object.3) GOOD UI: UI is good and almost lag free. No annoying bloatware's. It has few HONOR specific pre-installed apps.4) GOOD STORAGE AND RAM: Just by extra of 2k you will get 12GB RAM and 512GB Storage. This provides ample room for local file storage.5) GOOD DESIGN: Slick and slim, light and well-balanced.CONS:The list is long and I would recommend you to go through it so you would not be regretted if planning to purchase.1) NO FAST CHARGING: Getting very slow charging with the provided LOCAL charger (Toreto-Htech TOR-566 30W). It takes almost 80 mins to charge the mobile and that is quite painful. It uses the proprietary charging protocol so you cannot use fast chargers from other brands. Also you don't have the option to buy the fast charger from their website or market. Tried multiple fast chargers but none of them worked. What is the benefit if the mobile supports 66W charging but HONOR is giving 30W LOCAL charger? The only reason can be to get extra profit from the customers. Because of that giving it 1 star otherwise 2 stars.2) NO GORILLA GLASS: It doesn't have the gorilla glass and that is quite surprising. We are buying a 40k phone without gorilla glass. Also it is tough to get a tempered glass for HONOR 90 screen as it is quad curved and most of the sellers are selling dual curved tempered glass which doesn't fit properly.  So you have to be EXTRA EXTRA careful.3) NO GOOD BATTERY: Even with very moderate use, it doesn't last for more than 11-12 hours. You must have to charge twice a day and for heavy users might be 3 times. This is unfortunate, despite being manufactured on a modern 4nm process. Also when it gets below 5%, mobile gets switched off suddenly and this happened almost all the times.4) NO OIS: Observed shaky pictures and videos while on move or clicking moving objects. Really disappointed as now a days every phone manufacturer provides OIS even in 15-20k segment.5) NOT FOR NIGHT PHOTOGRAPHY: It takes decent photos in daylight but struggles a lot in night and really sucks. Most all of the night photos have lot of noise and useless. Also the ultra-wide camera is very inconsistent compared to primary camera. The 200 Megapixel camera is just a marketing gimmick. The 12 MP cameras of Samsung/Apple takes much better photo. Don’t go with the numbers, go with the optimizations.6) NO DUAL SPEAKERS: It has single speaker at down side and the output is not adequate. Definitely not for multi-media and gaming. Forget about the DOLBY atmos. Ironically HONOR is providing good display but bad speakers. Totally ruining the multimedia experience. One of the major drawback I found is that if you put the mobile on your chest while watching content, the sound becomes so feeble that hardly one can hear as the speaker grill gets covered.7) NOT FOR DURABILTY: Frame and body both are made of plastic body (or polycarbonate). The back panel looks like a glass but it is also a pure plastic. It looks fancy but build quality is bad. Please watch you tube video of Gupta Ji on YouTube (HONOR has a Serious Problem - HONOR 90 5G Durability & Bend Test)8) NO FLAGSHIP PROCESSOR: It has mid-range processor and I didn't find any lag in day to day operations but definitely not recommended for heavy tasks such as video editing and gaming.  Even the almost half price iQOO Z7 has much better processor. At least they should provide snapdragon 7 gen 2.UPDATE: Now after using it for 45 days, the phone phone is getting slow and it takes few seconds to open the Apps. And until the APP doesn't get opens it shows blank (see the attached screenshot)9) NOT FOR GAMING: Gaming experience is very BAD. It is jittery while playing the games and observed lot of frame drops. You cannot play the games for long time as it gets overheated very quickly.10) NO AUDIO CALL RECORDING: It doesn't have the option of call recording for the audio calls.11) NO VIDEO CALLING: It doesn't have the option to dial a video call.12) NO WI-FI CALLING: It doesn't have the option of WI-FI calling. This is bad if you are living in area with bad mobile signal reception.13) NO IR BLASTER: It doesn't have IR Blaster.  It cannot be used as remote to control your home devices such as TV, AC etc.14) NO PREMIUM LEVEL HAPTICS: It feels that you are using a very basic entry level vibration motor.15) NO WIRELESS CHARGING: It doesn't have support of wireless charging.16) NO LONG TERM SOFTWARE SUPPORT: HONOR is providing only two major OS updates and three years of security patches, which is less compared to OnePlus, Samsung, and Google in the same price range, who offer more robust software support.17) NO for bundled software's: It provides HONOR health application so you can connect your HONOR watches. I tried to connect my HONOR 6 watch but with no success. Seems outdated bundled software's.18) NOT HONEST: HONOR marketing team projected this mobile as a flagship mobile but it is nowhere close to flagship mobiles for the features it offers. It should be projected as a strong mid-range contender where actually it belongs. They launched the mobile with MRP of 49,999/- and with INTRODUCTORY price of 39,999/- for the 12GB + 512GB variant. But within a few days it tanked to approx. 28k with offers. I have never seen such a massive price drop for any mobile which was just launched. We are getting fooled by seeing the illusive discount of 20k. In my honest opinion it should be priced approx. 25-28k. At this price I would suggest to go for iQOO Neo 7 Pro that provides more bang for the buck and provides flagship processor.19) NO CUSTOMER SUPPORT: Last and most important, there is no way to contact HONOR customer care. Called multiple times the customer care number, it always says wrong number. And with the provided email id/chat it always goes to some Arab countries. This is really risky affair. BUY ON YOUR OWN RISK.We are paying hefty premium price for a very mediocre specifications. I had a lot of expectations from HONOR as they were coming back after 3 years but totally disappointed. HONOR marketing team is able to create the hype but not able to provide a product with value for money. There are lot of compromises in features and build quality.\nRead more", "\n\n\n\n\n                    The media could not be loaded.\n                \n\n\n\n\xa0Here is the list what you must know before going to purchase it.. if any of these points is deal breaker for you m.

I hope they will fix it in updates sometimes it's charging fastly sometimes super slow.. still I'm enjoying this phone because I'm saying to myself it's ur favourite brand and they will fix things, I came here to look others review but sad no one reviewed this mobile yet.Best on display, back camera on day light, design, battery backup, mono speaker quality and audio recording is perfect, and storage, it can compete with iphones on day light not on low light I don't know why,Worst on other things\nRead more"]}{'title': '        vivo Y200 5G (Jungle Green, 8GB RAM, 128GB Storage) with No Cost EMI/Additional Exchange Offers       ', 'reviews': ['\n5g network problem not working\nRead more', '\nGood performance of battery and processor\nRead more', '\nAll rights but 8 128 ki jagh 8 256 hota to jayada maza ata..Lekin badhiya heLelo bhai\nRead more', '\nThis Vivo y200 5g product is good to buy, it provided multiple features and the UI is very good, front and back camera is good, bettery backup also good..\nRead more', '\nVivo is improving day by day.. no lagging, decent camera, quick refresh, nice design.. inshort best investment..\nRead more', '\ndisplay and The rest of the features are very good thank you Amazon\nRead more', '\nपैसे के हिसाब से 5500 बैटरी और 256 मेमोरी दिया जाना था बाकी सब अच्छा है 5g network ka issue hai\nRead more', '\nPoor battery and Amazon can’t even accepting return of this phone\nRead more']}{'title': '        vivo Y200 5G (Jungle Green, 8GB RAM, 128GB Storage) with No Cost EMI/Additional Exchange Offers       ', 'reviews': ['\n5g network problem not working\nRead more', '\nGood performance of battery and processor\nRead more', '\nAll rights but 8 128 ki jagh 8 256 hota to jayada maza ata..Lekin badhiya heLelo bhai\nRead more', '\nThis Vivo y200 5g product is good to buy, it provided multiple features and the UI is very good, front and back camera is good, bettery backup also good..\nRead more', '\nVivo is improving day by day.. no lagging, decent camera, quick refresh, nice design.. inshort best investment..\nRead more', '\ndisplay and The rest of the features are very good thank you Amazon\nRead more', '\nपैसे के हिसाब से 5500 बैटरी और 256 मेमोरी दिया जाना था बाकी सब अच्छा है 5g network ka issue hai\nRead more', '\nPoor battery and Amazon can’t even accepting return of this phone\nRead more']}{'title': '        iQOO Neo 7 Pro 5G (Fearless Flame, 8GB RAM, 128GB Storage) | Snapdragon® 8+ Gen 1 | Independent Gaming Chip | Flagship 50MP OIS Camera | Premium Leather Design       ', 'reviews': ["\nI am writing this review after 1 day of use1. Cemra is nice (im am not much photo lover) for mine it is nice2. Phone look nice and not So heavy3. Battery working very nice when i got this battery was 50% charge after some data transfer frm my old phn to this phn. when phn goes 20% i put on charge and it take almost 1 hour (20% to 100) but next day phn was 60 i put in charge and go for washer room (for 15 min) when i cane phn was 100 So now i thk people can understand. i don't kw how company claiming just 8 min for 0 to 50 i don't thik its working in real life4. DISPLAY is good (outdoor too)5. Now main point for gaming i played 2.5 hours bgmi fom this phn it took 30% (monster mode on) full brightness No problem in battery or screen side but i feel leg and i continues (not so hard but i feel bcz before this phn i play in my Iphn 11) So according to that phn i feel i dnt kw how? Bcz this phn has 8+1 also separate chip for gaming. Also Anti Aliasing was not working On HDR/Extrem i tried many time to put on 2x but that option automatically put himself Close. i kw all that is Software issue (phn has very good chip set) and Iqoo need to solve this immediately No scop Aim and Scop Aim is totally different on same position without moving this is need to solve.6.Dual speaker is just Ok Not too loud not So bad.7.

This phone lags on many applications such as Amazon, battery drains faster specially when internet is turned on and most importantly, THE LOWER HALF OF THE SCREEN TURNS BLACK RANDOMLY. It happened twice just in last couple hours. I hope these issues gets resolved soon otherwise these heavy specs are just for the show.\nRead more", "\nI bought 256GB with 12 GB Ram Blue glass variant.1.

Casual usage last more than a day.5. Fast charging 120 Watts - 1% to 100% within 25 minutes.6. Haptic feedback is just ok.7. Cooling features are very good.

Performance is in OK level, and doesn't feel like a flagship phone.  Gaming performance is also ok but I'm not a gaming person even though I felt bit okok in BGMI.2. Battery backup is good, but charging speed doesn't meet the given norms. It's takes 13 min to charge 0 to 50% and it's takes arround 25-28 min for 0 to 100%. Even the 66w charger for Neo 6 also charging in the same speed. Just 120w charger is a naming that's it.3. Camera is decent and feature are good4. When it come to display, I didn't feel nice because I'm a Samsung user before, even the 16k phone's display also good in that. I compared my old Samsung and this Iqoo Neo 7 pro and Samsung phone got a plus point from my side.I bought this for video editing, It felt nice during editing and quick processing.But 3.0 GHz felt bit slow refesh rate for Snapdragon 8 gen 1..5. Fingerprint, face recognition, vibration etc are fine.But playing BGMI in normal mode and Monster mode doesn't make any difference in gaming performance.\nRead more", '\npackaging was good and NEW... Thanks amazon for genuine product\nRead more', "\nIn every point of view it's value for money. One problem was it's battery drains so early\nRead more", "\nI planned to switch to iQOO Neo 7 Pro due to budget constraints and moreover, I did not want to spend 40k or 50k just to get a branded phone. I got the 12gb/256gb variant for under 35k with a card discount.This has been my best decision so far!I've used the phone for about a week and can share my opinion based on what I've observed and liked about it:It's well-built, and the vegan leather back looks good. The appeal depends on personal material choice. Nevertheless, it does feel premium.The performance is super-smooth. I've kept the phone on default settings and it runs buttery smooth for day-to-day operations and gaming.On average, I get 7 to 8 hours of screen-on-time with normal to heavy usage. I'm not much of a gamer, but even with everyday tasks, streaming, an hour or two of gaming, chats, some office tasks, and daily apps, it lasts around 7.5 to 8 hours with 5 to 10% battery left.What I Didn't Like:Although it has an AMOLED screen, it lacks the punch and sharpness I expected. It's an above-average display. Streaming content looks fine, but the general display feels a bit dull. Note: You'll only notice the difference if you've used a high-density, pixel-heavy AMOLED panel before, like those in Samsung's premium phones.The software feels below average. It doesn't seem optimized, and it appears the UI was built by a team of interns at iQOO. I didn't encounter any bugs, but the color OS experience doesn't match the expectation of a 35k phone. You'll find better UI experiences in budget phones nowadays. The software is a notable let-down.The camera is decent, it isn't something extra-ordinary to talk about. If you are looking for a camera-centric phone - this ain't it, chief.In Conclusion:Apart from the software experience, this phone offers fantastic value for its price segment. If you can overlook the software quirks and make-do with the camera setup, iQOO Neo 7 is a solid choice!\nRead more", '\nNaic game  mobile pubg free fire  good graphics \nRead more']}{'title': '        Nothing Phone (2) 5G (White, 12GB RAM, 512GB Storage) | 6.7 Inch LTPO OLED AMOLED Display | 50 MP(OIS)+50MP | 32MP Front Camera | Qualcomm Snapdragon 8+Gen 1 | 4700 mAh Battery 45W:100% in 55 Minutes       ', 'reviews': ['\nNo adapter no screen guard which was mentioned no phone cover rest after using share the review again..

It's very thin and lightweight and the curved edges make it very comfortable to hold on for longer periods.Also the glass sandwich built feels premium.Next coming to display, the 120 hz curved amoled panel is in one word, splendid. It offers an immersive viewing experience with buttery smooth output. It also supports up to 1300 nits of peak brightness which helps viewing in direct sunlight.Now, when you buy a IQOO device you don't have to worry about the performance. It shares the typical IQOO dna and is powered by MediaTek dimensity 7200. The processor is very capable in running daily tasks and graphic intensive games. I am not much of a hardcore gamer but so far what I have tested I'm impressed. Games like BGMI, COD, Genshin Impact runs smoothly in this device with good graphic settings. IQOO also has done a job in cooling the processor, it barely gets hot while gaming.Next coming to camera, it has a 64 megapixel rear sensor which offers very good photos in daylight as well as night time. And the 16 megapixel front sensor is good too. The rear sensor can do 4k 30fps video recording and the front is locked at 1080p 30fps. Now, I am not that much of a camera guy, watching a camera review of this device will surely give you a better idea.After that I would like to share my thoughts on the battery and charging department. I was a little concerned about the 4600mah battery capacity and the 120hz display combo but surprisingly the battery holds up pretty well. I get easily a whole day of usage with 6-7 hours of screen on time which also includes gaming. The 66w charging adaptor charges the device from 0 to 100 in about 55 minutes which I believe is pretty good.Coming to network and connectivity, I haven't really got the opportunity to test the 5G connectivity as my local area does no not have 5G network. But 4G plus career aggregation is very constant and it offers good uploading and downloading speeds.The last thing to talk is about software. The device comes with the latest Funtouch OS 13 based on Android 13 and IQOO has promised 2 years of OS and 3 years of security patches which is decent.Personally I don't like the Funtouch OS much. I am coming from OneUI and compared to that this OS feels a little bit less lively. The animations are fluid and it also has all the necessary features but it needs more polishing. Do note I haven't faced any bugs in the software but there are a few advertisements which you can turn off and then it becomes a  very clean experience. The software experience completely varies from user to user so you might not be bothered by it at well. I just hope the brand polishes their UI more.Coming to compromises, it only has three which in my case is not much of an issue. It has an avarage vibration motor which doesn't offer flagship like experience. This device comes with a mono speaker which is decent. I'm coming from a device with a single speaker so it doesn't bother me as such. Also instead of the 2mp macro sensor a telephoto or ultrawide angle lens would have been highly appreciated.In conclusion, it can be said that it is a very good overall package if you can get it at 22k with the card offers. But for 24k it could've been better. It misses a few corners which would have made it perfect under 25k.

The deisgn of this nord 3 series  is also déjà vu .  However after use of few days , first of all i noticed - - The phone has pure plastic built with glossy polycarbonate glass back . Though it captures no finger print .- Hybrid sim tray with either dual sim or one sim and MSD card- Comes with IR blaster to use this phone as remote.- Top and bottom Dual speaker with dolby atmos sound . Bottom speaker gives you bass effect of the music while top acts like twitter.  Overall sound quality is quite loud and sweet .- Has NFC payment support which is quite attractive part .

The whole smartphone body has 12 temperature sensor .- It has UFS 3.1 storage capacity . It comes with 23 Gb system equipped storage.***BUT ///- Has very average camera with allmost poor processing . It has flagship sony sensor which has been used in oneplus 11 too  but one plus team was very lazy to make it more optimzed for this device . So always déjà vu dont give you good experience.- Oneplus is known for good camera smartphone but picture quality of this Nord CE 3 looks like the smartphones under 10000 . Colors of the pictures looks like washed out with less detail- night mode pictures does not makes so much of difference than the photos taken in normal mode . Colors, lights and exposures both stay allmost same- video quality is good but can be improved more . It has OIS image stabiliization which works only at 1080p 60 fps- 2x loseless zoom is a good feature .- Selfie camera is quite good  and takes bright picture . Has screen flash option . selfie camera shoots full hd video . Has pano and night mode option too .- being a mid level flagship phone missing Potrait video mode and pro video mode .- Macro camera is quite ok .* This phone strictly uses google dialer, so no more silent call record . And there are no one plus dialer .* Has no out of the box optimization , junk cleaning and antivirus software.* No alert slider* No 3.5mm jackSo i think one plus should give a immediate update to fix the camera optimization issue for this great hardware . Otherwise this is a very good balanced phone for every task .

She has upgraded from the OnePlus 7, where as I use the OnePlus 9Pro.While setting up the phone for her and during basic usage of WhatsApp or Instagram, there's hardly any difference to the naked eye between this Nord 3 CE and other flagships. The display is solid, good colours. The fingerprint and face unlock are super fast. The haptic feedback while typing and navigation is very responsive. Oxygen OS 13 is stable and well optimised. Makes the experience of using this phone very smooth.Battery performance is excellent too. Goes from 10-80% in 25 mins. And a full 100% lasts 30-40 hours depending on usage.Camera is okay. Meant for those who have simple and basic usage. Video - OIS is average.The only thing I didn't like is the back cover. Feels very delicate. It's like a thin silicone-plastic layer, that's it. OnePlus should have used better material for the back to make the phone more sturdy. My mom has an old OnePlus Nord 2 CE Lite. Even that has a more sturdy back cover.Verdict: At 25k with back discount, this phone is phenomenal for the average user (priority is calls with everyday social media usage and browsing on Chrome). Performance, display, battery, OS are all pretty solid.But if you are a content creator who wishes to record high quality videos for making reels or YouTube videos, or your work needs you to continusly have your video on for Zoom meetings, then maybe, this phone is not for you. You'll need to consider investing in a better phone above the 35-40k price range.\nRead more", "\nHave been using the phone for over a week now.Positives:1. Snapdragon 782 processor is quite good. There is no lag whatsoever even on opening multiple apps and using for a long time.2. Battery life is decent. It is definitely not a gaming mobile.3. 5G services are accessible in most locations(in Hyderabad) wherever there is network.4. Both front and rear cameras are decent. You can click good shots in Night mode as well. Photos taken in various modes viz., Macro, Extra HD, Night, Pro, Potrait are attached.5. 80W fast charging is electric! I was able to charge my mobile from 23% to 100% in 17-18 mins and from 4% to 100% in 22-23 mins.6. Audio and video quality is great. Get some good earphones and you will experience the theatre effect with Dolby sound.7. No heating issue of any kind even after continuous usage/a long phone call.8. 12 GB RAM is great. You can now multitask and open apps simultaneously.Negatives:1. Battery drains fast. Should have been built to last longer. Like I said, definitely not a gamer's mobile. However, phone will last for a day even with heavy usage.2. Flagship 50MP Sony camera is a disappointment. Definitely not what an amateur photographer would expect. The moment you zoom in, image gets blurred and pixelated. Expected a much better camera from a mid premium mobile at priced at 30k3. Most of the features were toned down from other premium versions of OnePlus. However, one would expect some premium features when spending almost 30k.4. Back cover and screen guard are useless. Expected OnePlus to provide decent good quality default screen guard and phone cases. Please do buy both separately.5. Audio/Video seems to just stop and then play on using YouTube. Might have to update the app and check if it is an issue with the device.6. Absence of a 3.5mm audio jack is a big drawback for wired earphone users.Update 1 : Have received the first update to Oxygen 13.1 within 2-3 days of purchase wherein video quality of camera and few other features were improved. Also, the video lag issue is now resolved.Update 2: Received second software update on 23 Aug 2023 which is aimed at improving front/rear camera picture quality and optimizing the battery of the mobile when it is at rest.Update 3: Received another software upgrade in early October aimed at enhancing Network connectivity and stabilization.Overall a decent buy under 30k segment. Expected better features from a premium smartphone but certainly not a big disappointment. Overall 4 stars. I would recommend this mobile to others.\nRead more"]}{'title': '        realme narzo 60 Pro (Cosmic Black,12GB+1TB) Ultra Smooth 120 Hz Super Amoled Curved Display | 100 MP OIS Camera       ', 'reviews': ["\nI bought myself this Realme Narzo 60 Pro (Cosmic Black,8GB+128GB) Ultra Smooth 120 Hz Super AMOLED Curved Display | 100 MP OIS Camera for Rs.22k.

Comfortable to hold. No heating during regular use. Heats up a bit while charging. Fingerprint sensor is very quick and responsive.But you need to know how to handle a Realme device to get the most of it.1st thing is bloatware. Disable/uninstall all the apps you're not going to use.2nd thing is battery. Battery backup is very good, and charging is blazing fast, but to get good backup, you need to disable the dozens of bloatware apps, random location/Bluetooth permissions and background/foreground data usage for each app separately, except for the ones from which you need regular notifications, like email or chat.After these two things, which can take a couple of hours, you're set. The phone works like a dream and is very fast and intuitive.Bottomline: it's a good phone, but like any other Realme device, needs work from the user in order to not be annoying.

Note: I used insta for like a hour and was not using it continously and listening to music when battery was about 20%.Even all this, 21 fe is a great phone but due to it's age (from release date) , battery may be weak\nRead more", "\nI am not a gamer & Overall I like everything in this phone except battery backup.Pros- Good build quality- Great stereo speakers- Great screen- Great Software (Android 13 with Feb patch)- Not as compact as S23 but not as big as Neo 7 or OnePlus 11r. Both the other phones are about 8mm taller than this, which is definitely a problem.Cons-- You will get 5-6hrs of SOT with 5-6 hours of standby time on 4g (5g disabled, wifi off, AOD off, brightness 30%). However, on a regulad working day ( 1-1. 5 hrs of SOT with plenty of music ), you can end your day witb over 60% battery.- Doesn't hesitates to get warm (not hot) if you try to push it hard. Like if there are multiple updates etc running and you are using it at the same time. This is irritating but not a problem.Other Info:- Takes 1.5 hrs to charge (10-100%) with 15w pd charger.- Only one bug, when you install any app it get's stuck at ~33% for a minute or so.Overall I am satisfied with my purchase.\nRead more", "\nThe phone would've been a better buy had it been launched in 40K-50K segment.The display is awesome. Even though adaptive refresh rate screen has been used, it can't be noticed in normal use. It supports 4K resolution gives a good clarity and bright colors.The phone works great in almost all conditions. It does all tasks effortlessly.Gaming experience has been fine. Played COD for 45 min, no stutters and negligible lags. The phone just got a little warm after 30 min. I don't play a lot so my opinion may differ from heavy mobile gamers.Haven't faced any heating issue. It did got warm during the setup period and gets a little bit hot from some areas during the camera usage.Battery efficiency has been fine with 5-6 hours of screen on time as is with any flagship level phone. Heavy users may need to charge again in a day.Build quality is good, the metal frame along with the curved edges gives a premium and compact feel. The back however could've been better. The texture allows for smudges to get easily printed. That ruins the look of the phone. A back cover will solve the problem.While shaking the phone a clicking sound can be heard. It's mild. Another user faced this so I tried too. It's true. I think it's because of the OIS mechanical system. It might be colliding with its frame so that may be producing this sound. It hasn't created any problems though.The speakers are good. Balanced sound comes from the stereo speakers. They are loud and crisp enough.The overall performance is great. I love the phone. The price is a little irksome though. Should've launched around 45K given the time of the launch of the phone.The non availability of a charger is a cheap trick by Samsung.If one frequently changes their phone like in a year or two, then go for S20 FE 5G. That's a better value for money phone. Given the 2 generation old processor and another 2 years of OS updates left, the S20 FE 5G will be a better buy for frequent changers.\nRead more", "\nIts been 60 days i'm using this phone and going to share pros n cons of the phone.Pro:1. Its display is the main key which attracts viewers to buy this phone. Its very attractive, clear with high color depth.2. The sleek metallic sides are looking very nice.3. No lag found yet.4. I am playing battelground from day 1 and did not find any heat issues or delay in response.5. The battery backup is amazing.Cons:The main drawback of the phone is its camera.The camera quality and color depth is like a Rs15 thousand phone. Camera really disappointed.It has 30x zoom but you can not use even 3x zoom. The picture quality will be reduced like hell.Sometimes it seems i am using VGA camera to capture pictures.I was using Samsung Note 8 earlier, the camera of note series was awesome. It was pure 4k recording.This samsung s21fe provides 4k and UHD recording but does not seems like it is UHD. It seems like a recording from 5MP third class camera.No edge display.It really disappointed me.Now i am looking for change.\nRead more"]}{'title': '        STAND OUT Men Regular Fit T-Shirt       ', 'reviews': ['\nNeck size is small\nRead more', '\nOkay for all goku fans, please go for it without thinking, the print is the same as shown and it looks really cool and different.

Mi is a good brand in mobile phones and i personally use all Mi phones since years which are good, but this brand is not so as good in TV's, most Indians make this mistake using the brand loyalty of mobiles to buy tv of same brand, but that should not be done at all.Cons:1. Most features mentioned by Mi will actually Not work practically. Eg. Ambient light sensor doesn't work at all. Storage empty will keep showing the same even after you have transferred big movies,files and exhausted storage. If you download any file manager from Play Store it can show you real statistics and allow you to access but Mi own software can't do that.2. While playing some HD or Dolby content on YouTube or Hotstar the picture settings will go the max even after you keep backlight+brightness+contrast to even zero. This happens same in both normal light and complete darkness. This happens in no brand tv as I have verified on TCL/OnePlus/toshiba/hisense/etc. Even the technician from Mi came and saw and couldn't solve it. It really strains your eyes to such extent that you can't watch tv at all.3. Some connectivity issues. Eg. If you get connected once somehow but delete that pairing (or reset tv) and try to reconnect then it's on your luck but technically inefficient software.4. Mi mentions no where on their website or specifications that what panel they are using. In the showroom display you will find IPS panel, but in all possible orders you will receive a VA panel. I tested it myself.5. There are many bugs which one can with time or indepth usage.6. Mi technicians are the worst you can find. They have absolutely no idea about the tv their basic features. Also they will give wrong guidance and feedback, no matter what you show them. Don't know if Mi brand only instructs then to do such way and company will try their level best to sell their defective products and not take them back. Amazon's installers are way more knowledgeable than that of Mi technicians.7. This tv original model number and manufacture date will be many months or even years back but when you get the sealed box, the boxes and their model numbers will be different and latest. Don't know if Mi is selling refurbished models or not.8. Mi quality check team is also not very efficient it seems from my experience.9. Voice command is the worst, it can't give you desired results at ll.Now the Pros:1. The picture is much better clear detailed than some brands like TCL.2. Sound of 30W is also good, but expect not much Bass from them.3. It's VA panel hence gives darker black.Summary:If you are buying a tv, shortlisting brands who are in the tv industry for decades eg. Hisense, Samsung, Lg. would be more sensible. MOST Important, always buy from Amazon and not directly from the brand's because if anything wrong happens with the customer, Amazon will be a life saver. Amazon customer support, system, installers are all professionals, expert and helpful to guard you. In my research and i personally have shortlisted Hisense tv after physically seeing them. Almost at similar price ranges, Mi tv cannot even come closer to Hisense tv be it image quality or sound. For example if you actually see and hear Hisense Tornado then one can't take Mi ever. Now I can only buy a Hisense tv with their thousands of customer support offices opening in India.\nRead more", "\nThis 43-inch Redmi TV offers an impressive viewing experience.

One has indicator light in the middle and other one has on right side.The one with indicator light on right side is the real product as per description. If you get the other one, replace it immediately because it has screen issues which normal people couldn't identify. The blacks are displayed greyish due to faulty display. The model/serial number sticker behind the TV is not stuck properly. Looks like refurbished or duplicate product. U can see the attached imagesNow for the proper one (with indicator on right side)1. Performance: since it's a basic TV, the response is quite good. Smooth and speedy operation2. Display: The quality of display is great. Colors are crisp and clear just as mentioned in the description. Perfect display at low cost.3. Build: plastic used for the body is sturdy but assembly is done by the worst. The buttons behind the TV doesn't align with actual button inside so we are unable to use it. It may look like borderless design but there is black border on the screen instead of bezel. So no point of calling it as bezzelless design.4. Remote: Basic IR remote. It has a good range but u have to face the remote to the center of the TV5. Connectivity: it has 2 HDMI, 2 AUX, 2USB and 1 audio jack.. works smooth and fine.6. Audio: moderate quality with very low bass. U will hear audio chitter if u increase the volume beyond 40%. But the audio is quite loud at 20 to 30%. So not a major issue.7. Accessories: it comes with remote, table mount, wall mount. The wall mount is just 2 metal hook type thing. So it's better to go for good quality one if you are thinking of mounting on wall.Overall it's worth the money. 32 inch TV on such low cost is great considering the cost of 24 inch TVs are similar with same quality in branded models.

I was told AUE60 & AUE70(the models listed here as Crystal 4K and 4K Pro) are E-commerce exclusive models, not available offline. I was shown AU7700 which has the same processor, panel and features, but was listed at 65K for the 55" version. I liked the picture quality, and decided I\'ll get the AUE60 since it shares so much with AU7700, and save ~20k.Why I went for AUE60  vs. AUE70 - I knew I wouldn\'t be needing a voice assistant, and wanted to save 3k. I knew even if I wanted a voice assistant, I could plug in Fire TV/Mi TV box and get those features later on. Delivery was pretty hassle free, the delivery executive unloaded the TV in the room I asked for, and opened the box to inspect the TV for any physical damages. Samsung technicians came in a few hours later, installed and gave a demo.Sound:Per other reviews - sound from speakers is apparently bad, but in my case, I found it satisfactory. I have it wall mounted in a 10X12ft room, and the TV\'s speakers sound better compared to Bose Soundlink Speakers that I connected it to via Bluetooth.Picture:The Panel\'s great, but nothing worth raving about. Gray uniformity isn\'t great(i.e. gray tones won\'t be perfectly uniform across the whole panel, there\'ll be darker zones towards the edges/corners based on backlight placement). Blacks aren\'t perfectly black - and they\'re brighter than you\'d expect from a VA panel, but this isn\'t noticeable at all when the room is lit. No backlight bleed. Colors are as good as I\'d like them to be, and the panel does get noticeably bright for my taste, even when brightness is turned down to 40%. 720p content is watchable from >8ft, 1080p is good(I\'d say better than I expected), and 4K is well, 4K.Connectivity:I have a 35 Mb/s broadband  connection and all content streams in 4K when available, without stutters. The TV has Bluetooth 5.0, and works with TWS and Neckband earphones fine(I use Oppo Enco W51 and Boat Rockerz 330) - there\'s no noticeable latency, and volume can be controlled through the remote itself.Apps & Features:Has all the standard slew of streaming apps I needed - Netflix, Hotstar, Prime, Apple TV+ & YouTube. All of them stream 4k content, except for Hotstar - which only streamed 4K a few times. 1080p is still very watchable, and not really a deal breaker. No Dolby Vision support - which I made my peace with considering the fact that 99% of budget TVs in the market can\'t produce the contrast you\'d expect out of DV content anyways, so why care. You get HDR, and HDR content is definitely better looking than non-HDR ones in terms of colors and vibrancy. I planned to use the TV without cable, but the TV does come with some channels like Republic TV, Bloomberg, 9XM, etc., these stream in 1080p, so a great bonus to have.Remote:Very basic RF remote, unlike Bluetooth ones on most new TVs. The remote\'s looks pretty sleek and stylish, but that\'s about it. Biggest gripe - typing to search for things within apps is a pain in the behind, you\'ll need to use the D-pad to navigate on an on-screen keyboard. You can control the TV using Samsung\'s SmartThings App, but guess what - you can\'t even use your phone\'s keyboard to type in when controlling through the app - this is something that can be added through an update, but it\'s not there yet.Attached pictures are all of 4K content. Resolution might get scaled down after I submit the review, but you can still get an idea of the TV\'s design/looks, Panel colors and contrast, etc.I\'d say I\'m really happy - and given the chance, wouldn\'t change my decision. It\'s a Samsung TV, so end of the day, if it produces a decent picture, and lasts a couple of years more than I expect, I can overlook all other cons. I\'d highly recommend the TV if you have the same expectations from your next TV.\nRead more', "\n\n\n\n\n                    The media could not be loaded.\n                \n\n\n\n\xa0I recently took the plunge into the world of smart TVs, starting with the Samsung i Smart Cue60 model from Amazon. At first, everything seemed peachy keen, but my excitement quickly plummeted when I discovered four pesky dead pixels just a few days into the TV affair. Kudos to Amazon's customer service, though—they swooped in with efficiency after my distress call. Despite the pixel debacle, they swiftly processed my refund, leaving me both grateful and TV-less. Undeterred, I decided to give it another shot and turned to Flipkart for a second act, choosing the Samsung Cue70 model with its promising Assistant feature. Well, fate had a different script for me this time. Lo and behold, I unwrapped a used TV with questionable packaging and a rather prominent dead pixel. Frustrated with the cycle of returns, I sought advice from a tech-savvy friend who nonchalantly informed me that dead pixels are the norm in LED TVs. Armed with a two-year warranty, I decided to keep the TV, throwing caution to the wind. I even opted for an extra year of coverage, playing the long game. Whether this gamble pays off or not is a cliffhanger in itself. As I embark on this uncertain TV journey, I feel compelled to warn potential buyers of the Cue60 and Cue70 models—brace yourselves for the dead pixel roulette; chances are, you might find yourself spinning the wheel. For the rest of us, let's not sweat the small stuff—these are just materialistic things. Life has more important matters to offer. Here's to staying calm and embracing the uncertainties of the electronic world! Cheers to a pixel-perfect future or not. \nRead more", "\nLikes:1. Display quality is good2. Audio depth is good3.

Vu Gloled has better sound quality compare to vu Cinema tv models. but still needs improvement in sound quality.-Picture Quality is good. Panel brightness is 400 nits (very high) just need to set backlight to 50% to reduce eyes strain. Colors production is good.  HD, 4K Content looks very nice, if you are OTT user you will enjoy the picture quality but if you are using Set Top box SD Channels quality may disappoint you, this TV enhance the SD quality.- I preferred this tv over samsung as Samsung has Tizen OS and you don't get much apps there you get Google play store and lots of apps to install.- Sound Quality Vu still needs some improvement in sound, Sound is improved compared to previous vu models but it misses the clarity.Overall I am satisfied with the purchase.\nRead more", '\nPROS :PICTUREExcellent Panel Quality. The VU GLOLED 50 INCH Panel Quality is extremely good . The display is extremely bright panel for a 50 inch 4K TV and it has one of the best brightness levels in its category. The Colour Science of the Panel is slightly tuned towards the LG colour science . The panel support Dolby Vision /  HDR10 / HDR10+ as well as HLG video formats and watching the content on OTT apps is amazing. The default colour setting was little oversaturated to my liking but VU Gloled gives ample setting to tweak and adjust the same.  The TV comes with features like MEMC ( Motion Enhancement ) by default and the settings can be tweaked separately for each source ( HD Content / Dolby Vision Content / HDR10 / HDR10+ ) . The panel is manufactured by OEM Hisense and the quality is on par with the A6H/A7H. It is one of the best budget panels in the market. The viewing angels are also good unless you want to watch the TV from the extreme ends which will result in some color differences which makes me believe the Panel is a high quality VA panelSPEAKERS :The VU Gloled has a good sound quality when compared to the general sound quality . The best part is the sub woofer is inbuilt with bottom firing speakers. If we do not go by the 104W expectation the speakers do a decent job and its better than what the normal tv in the price range offers. If you do not want to invest or interested in a soundbar and you want a TV with good sound quality this TV is the best suited for you . Also the sub woofer can be turned off in the settings if you are not interested . Also there are ample  of settings for the sound tweaking as well and you can tweak it to your preference.  Also Dolby ATMOS support works well with the TVInstallation :The Wall Mounts and stand  are provided in the box. The assembly was done by Amazon at the time of delivery itself so I did not have any issues . The packaging and installation done by the Amazon team was good without issuesAccessories:The TV comes with all the ports required as well as the Remote . The remoteless far field mic works well . The Remote has ample buttons with dedicated hot keys for all the favourite OTT apps as well. The find my remote functionality enables you to find the remote if it is lost which is a really useful feature.OS / HardwareThe processor as shown in AIDA64 is m7632 . Processor is Mediatek MT9612 . It is 4 cores Cortex A55 @ 1500 MHz & GPU is Mali G52 GPU .The processor is one of the better processors for TV and comes with support for latest video codes like AV1. Mother Board codename is his9612 .  RAM is 1790 MB & Storage is 16GB out of which around half is already consumed by Google TV. Most of preinstalled OTT apps can be uninstalled except some like Youtube.  Google TV takes around 35 to 40 seconds to boot up and the OS is better than the Android TV OS . The Google TV mobile app makes controlling the TV and typing ridiculously easy and the  Voice search is now across all the apps / system wide . Google Apps can be installed and you can also install 3rd party apps.  Google OS is basically better version of old Android TV Version.After Sales Service / Extended WarrantyVU offers additional 2 years comprehensive warranty from their website.  If  looking for a long term purchase I would highly recommend getting the official extended warranty from their website. The customer care team was really helpful while extending the warranty and the timelines were followed. You can check the warranty online on their website.Area for Improvement : No updates apart from the Google OS bi-monthly new feature rollouts. The VU team must also look to provide updates to the GLOLED lineup .Cons : With bluetooth headphones connected, the sound is comparatively  lower . Seems to  a common issue across units and it must be a software bug which could be fixed if VU provides an update.Overall Conclusion : If you are looking for a 4K 50 inch TV with good Panel quality  , good sound quality and better customer support than some other competitors  in a budget this is a must buy TV for you . This is definitely one of the best TV in its price segment and you cannot go wrong with it .\nRead more', '\nI\'m writing review after 6 months of purchase..My overall experience for the 43 INCH VU TV is good in terms of viewing angle, Sound experience and picture quality. I loved the Dolby feature .. You can customise your tv based on your tatse as it has lot more options.I liked the remote features pretty much to navigate to the suggested apps pretty quickly in one single tap. However in the past two months the batteries in the remote were liquidied in the remote ineffective which the picture is getting changed between cinematic & standard mode.After consulting through VU technician they\'ve advised us to use ONLY "ALKALINE BATTERIES" from Duracell which will last longer and remote consumes more power.Apart from the everything is smooth & good. Interesting fact is if remote doesn\'t work you can use google home feature to control your tv.All other features are well and good.\nRead more', '\nMost value for money product and very reliable service and support\nRead more', '\nThe picture quality is too good in VU\nRead more', "\nProsWriting this review after few days of usePicture quality is excellent.

I was told AUE60 & AUE70(the models listed here as Crystal 4K and 4K Pro) are E-commerce exclusive models, not available offline. I was shown AU7700 which has the same processor, panel and features, but was listed at 65K for the 55" version. I liked the picture quality, and decided I\'ll get the AUE60 since it shares so much with AU7700, and save ~20k.Why I went for AUE60  vs. AUE70 - I knew I wouldn\'t be needing a voice assistant, and wanted to save 3k. I knew even if I wanted a voice assistant, I could plug in Fire TV/Mi TV box and get those features later on. Delivery was pretty hassle free, the delivery executive unloaded the TV in the room I asked for, and opened the box to inspect the TV for any physical damages. Samsung technicians came in a few hours later, installed and gave a demo.Sound:Per other reviews - sound from speakers is apparently bad, but in my case, I found it satisfactory. I have it wall mounted in a 10X12ft room, and the TV\'s speakers sound better compared to Bose Soundlink Speakers that I connected it to via Bluetooth.Picture:The Panel\'s great, but nothing worth raving about. Gray uniformity isn\'t great(i.e. gray tones won\'t be perfectly uniform across the whole panel, there\'ll be darker zones towards the edges/corners based on backlight placement). Blacks aren\'t perfectly black - and they\'re brighter than you\'d expect from a VA panel, but this isn\'t noticeable at all when the room is lit. No backlight bleed. Colors are as good as I\'d like them to be, and the panel does get noticeably bright for my taste, even when brightness is turned down to 40%. 720p content is watchable from >8ft, 1080p is good(I\'d say better than I expected), and 4K is well, 4K.Connectivity:I have a 35 Mb/s broadband  connection and all content streams in 4K when available, without stutters. The TV has Bluetooth 5.0, and works with TWS and Neckband earphones fine(I use Oppo Enco W51 and Boat Rockerz 330) - there\'s no noticeable latency, and volume can be controlled through the remote itself.Apps & Features:Has all the standard slew of streaming apps I needed - Netflix, Hotstar, Prime, Apple TV+ & YouTube. All of them stream 4k content, except for Hotstar - which only streamed 4K a few times. 1080p is still very watchable, and not really a deal breaker. No Dolby Vision support - which I made my peace with considering the fact that 99% of budget TVs in the market can\'t produce the contrast you\'d expect out of DV content anyways, so why care. You get HDR, and HDR content is definitely better looking than non-HDR ones in terms of colors and vibrancy. I planned to use the TV without cable, but the TV does come with some channels like Republic TV, Bloomberg, 9XM, etc., these stream in 1080p, so a great bonus to have.Remote:Very basic RF remote, unlike Bluetooth ones on most new TVs. The remote\'s looks pretty sleek and stylish, but that\'s about it. Biggest gripe - typing to search for things within apps is a pain in the behind, you\'ll need to use the D-pad to navigate on an on-screen keyboard. You can control the TV using Samsung\'s SmartThings App, but guess what - you can\'t even use your phone\'s keyboard to type in when controlling through the app - this is something that can be added through an update, but it\'s not there yet.Attached pictures are all of 4K content. Resolution might get scaled down after I submit the review, but you can still get an idea of the TV\'s design/looks, Panel colors and contrast, etc.I\'d say I\'m really happy - and given the chance, wouldn\'t change my decision. It\'s a Samsung TV, so end of the day, if it produces a decent picture, and lasts a couple of years more than I expect, I can overlook all other cons. I\'d highly recommend the TV if you have the same expectations from your next TV.\nRead more', "\n\n\n\n\n                    The media could not be loaded.\n                \n\n\n\n\xa0I recently took the plunge into the world of smart TVs, starting with the Samsung i Smart Cue60 model from Amazon. At first, everything seemed peachy keen, but my excitement quickly plummeted when I discovered four pesky dead pixels just a few days into the TV affair. Kudos to Amazon's customer service, though—they swooped in with efficiency after my distress call. Despite the pixel debacle, they swiftly processed my refund, leaving me both grateful and TV-less. Undeterred, I decided to give it another shot and turned to Flipkart for a second act, choosing the Samsung Cue70 model with its promising Assistant feature. Well, fate had a different script for me this time. Lo and behold, I unwrapped a used TV with questionable packaging and a rather prominent dead pixel. Frustrated with the cycle of returns, I sought advice from a tech-savvy friend who nonchalantly informed me that dead pixels are the norm in LED TVs. Armed with a two-year warranty, I decided to keep the TV, throwing caution to the wind. I even opted for an extra year of coverage, playing the long game. Whether this gamble pays off or not is a cliffhanger in itself. As I embark on this uncertain TV journey, I feel compelled to warn potential buyers of the Cue60 and Cue70 models—brace yourselves for the dead pixel roulette; chances are, you might find yourself spinning the wheel. For the rest of us, let's not sweat the small stuff—these are just materialistic things. Life has more important matters to offer. Here's to staying calm and embracing the uncertainties of the electronic world! Cheers to a pixel-perfect future or not. \nRead more", "\nLikes:1. Display quality is good2. Audio depth is good3.

Installation is free. Comments were confusing - some said no stand and some mentioned about stand. So let me clarify. There was no table stand or wall mount stand in the box (though the thermocol had a groove for table stand). The installation guy though bought the wall mount stand (free). He said the swivel one will be for 3500Rs which can be installed later too.Resolution is good. It does not pixelate and works on wifi even with a n/w speed of 10MBps.Cons: 1 energy star.No clarity about stand. You don't get table stand in case you want to move the TV to another room.Overall I felt it was a good deal. Originally it was for 13990 then 12990 and for some time it was for 11990.

I was told AUE60 & AUE70(the models listed here as Crystal 4K and 4K Pro) are E-commerce exclusive models, not available offline. I was shown AU7700 which has the same processor, panel and features, but was listed at 65K for the 55" version. I liked the picture quality, and decided I\'ll get the AUE60 since it shares so much with AU7700, and save ~20k.Why I went for AUE60  vs. AUE70 - I knew I wouldn\'t be needing a voice assistant, and wanted to save 3k. I knew even if I wanted a voice assistant, I could plug in Fire TV/Mi TV box and get those features later on. Delivery was pretty hassle free, the delivery executive unloaded the TV in the room I asked for, and opened the box to inspect the TV for any physical damages. Samsung technicians came in a few hours later, installed and gave a demo.Sound:Per other reviews - sound from speakers is apparently bad, but in my case, I found it satisfactory. I have it wall mounted in a 10X12ft room, and the TV\'s speakers sound better compared to Bose Soundlink Speakers that I connected it to via Bluetooth.Picture:The Panel\'s great, but nothing worth raving about. Gray uniformity isn\'t great(i.e. gray tones won\'t be perfectly uniform across the whole panel, there\'ll be darker zones towards the edges/corners based on backlight placement). Blacks aren\'t perfectly black - and they\'re brighter than you\'d expect from a VA panel, but this isn\'t noticeable at all when the room is lit. No backlight bleed. Colors are as good as I\'d like them to be, and the panel does get noticeably bright for my taste, even when brightness is turned down to 40%. 720p content is watchable from >8ft, 1080p is good(I\'d say better than I expected), and 4K is well, 4K.Connectivity:I have a 35 Mb/s broadband  connection and all content streams in 4K when available, without stutters. The TV has Bluetooth 5.0, and works with TWS and Neckband earphones fine(I use Oppo Enco W51 and Boat Rockerz 330) - there\'s no noticeable latency, and volume can be controlled through the remote itself.Apps & Features:Has all the standard slew of streaming apps I needed - Netflix, Hotstar, Prime, Apple TV+ & YouTube. All of them stream 4k content, except for Hotstar - which only streamed 4K a few times. 1080p is still very watchable, and not really a deal breaker. No Dolby Vision support - which I made my peace with considering the fact that 99% of budget TVs in the market can\'t produce the contrast you\'d expect out of DV content anyways, so why care. You get HDR, and HDR content is definitely better looking than non-HDR ones in terms of colors and vibrancy. I planned to use the TV without cable, but the TV does come with some channels like Republic TV, Bloomberg, 9XM, etc., these stream in 1080p, so a great bonus to have.Remote:Very basic RF remote, unlike Bluetooth ones on most new TVs. The remote\'s looks pretty sleek and stylish, but that\'s about it. Biggest gripe - typing to search for things within apps is a pain in the behind, you\'ll need to use the D-pad to navigate on an on-screen keyboard.

Vu Gloled has better sound quality compare to vu Cinema tv models. but still needs improvement in sound quality.-Picture Quality is good. Panel brightness is 400 nits (very high) just need to set backlight to 50% to reduce eyes strain. Colors production is good.  HD, 4K Content looks very nice, if you are OTT user you will enjoy the picture quality but if you are using Set Top box SD Channels quality may disappoint you, this TV enhance the SD quality.- I preferred this tv over samsung as Samsung has Tizen OS and you don't get much apps there you get Google play store and lots of apps to install.- Sound Quality Vu still needs some improvement in sound, Sound is improved compared to previous vu models but it misses the clarity.Overall I am satisfied with the purchase.\nRead more", '\nPROS :PICTUREExcellent Panel Quality. The VU GLOLED 50 INCH Panel Quality is extremely good . The display is extremely bright panel for a 50 inch 4K TV and it has one of the best brightness levels in its category. The Colour Science of the Panel is slightly tuned towards the LG colour science . The panel support Dolby Vision /  HDR10 / HDR10+ as well as HLG video formats and watching the content on OTT apps is amazing. The default colour setting was little oversaturated to my liking but VU Gloled gives ample setting to tweak and adjust the same.  The TV comes with features like MEMC ( Motion Enhancement ) by default and the settings can be tweaked separately for each source ( HD Content / Dolby Vision Content / HDR10 / HDR10+ ) . The panel is manufactured by OEM Hisense and the quality is on par with the A6H/A7H. It is one of the best budget panels in the market. The viewing angels are also good unless you want to watch the TV from the extreme ends which will result in some color differences which makes me believe the Panel is a high quality VA panelSPEAKERS :The VU Gloled has a good sound quality when compared to the general sound quality . The best part is the sub woofer is inbuilt with bottom firing speakers. If we do not go by the 104W expectation the speakers do a decent job and its better than what the normal tv in the price range offers.

If  looking for a long term purchase I would highly recommend getting the official extended warranty from their website. The customer care team was really helpful while extending the warranty and the timelines were followed. You can check the warranty online on their website.Area for Improvement : No updates apart from the Google OS bi-monthly new feature rollouts. The VU team must also look to provide updates to the GLOLED lineup .Cons : With bluetooth headphones connected, the sound is comparatively  lower . Seems to  a common issue across units and it must be a software bug which could be fixed if VU provides an update.Overall Conclusion : If you are looking for a 4K 50 inch TV with good Panel quality  , good sound quality and better customer support than some other competitors  in a budget this is a must buy TV for you . This is definitely one of the best TV in its price segment and you cannot go wrong with it .\nRead more', '\nI\'m writing review after 6 months of purchase..My overall experience for the 43 INCH VU TV is good in terms of viewing angle, Sound experience and picture quality. I loved the Dolby feature .. You can customise your tv based on your tatse as it has lot more options.I liked the remote features pretty much to navigate to the suggested apps pretty quickly in one single tap. However in the past two months the batteries in the remote were liquidied in the remote ineffective which the picture is getting changed between cinematic & standard mode.After consulting through VU technician they\'ve advised us to use ONLY "ALKALINE BATTERIES" from Duracell which will last longer and remote consumes more power.Apart from the everything is smooth & good. Interesting fact is if remote doesn\'t work you can use google home feature to control your tv.All other features are well and good.\nRead more', '\nMost value for money product and very reliable service and support\nRead more', '\nThe picture quality is too good in VU\nRead more', "\nProsWriting this review after few days of usePicture quality is excellent.

Full value for money tv.ConsInstallation service very poor on calling the technician refused to come saying it's a holiday has to instalk the tv myself.

I was told AUE60 & AUE70(the models listed here as Crystal 4K and 4K Pro) are E-commerce exclusive models, not available offline. I was shown AU7700 which has the same processor, panel and features, but was listed at 65K for the 55" version. I liked the picture quality, and decided I\'ll get the AUE60 since it shares so much with AU7700, and save ~20k.Why I went for AUE60  vs. AUE70 - I knew I wouldn\'t be needing a voice assistant, and wanted to save 3k. I knew even if I wanted a voice assistant, I could plug in Fire TV/Mi TV box and get those features later on. Delivery was pretty hassle free, the delivery executive unloaded the TV in the room I asked for, and opened the box to inspect the TV for any physical damages. Samsung technicians came in a few hours later, installed and gave a demo.Sound:Per other reviews - sound from speakers is apparently bad, but in my case, I found it satisfactory. I have it wall mounted in a 10X12ft room, and the TV\'s speakers sound better compared to Bose Soundlink Speakers that I connected it to via Bluetooth.Picture:The Panel\'s great, but nothing worth raving about. Gray uniformity isn\'t great(i.e. gray tones won\'t be perfectly uniform across the whole panel, there\'ll be darker zones towards the edges/corners based on backlight placement). Blacks aren\'t perfectly black - and they\'re brighter than you\'d expect from a VA panel, but this isn\'t noticeable at all when the room is lit. No backlight bleed. Colors are as good as I\'d like them to be, and the panel does get noticeably bright for my taste, even when brightness is turned down to 40%. 720p content is watchable from >8ft, 1080p is good(I\'d say better than I expected), and 4K is well, 4K.Connectivity:I have a 35 Mb/s broadband  connection and all content streams in 4K when available, without stutters. The TV has Bluetooth 5.0, and works with TWS and Neckband earphones fine(I use Oppo Enco W51 and Boat Rockerz 330) - there\'s no noticeable latency, and volume can be controlled through the remote itself.Apps & Features:Has all the standard slew of streaming apps I needed - Netflix, Hotstar, Prime, Apple TV+ & YouTube. All of them stream 4k content, except for Hotstar - which only streamed 4K a few times. 1080p is still very watchable, and not really a deal breaker. No Dolby Vision support - which I made my peace with considering the fact that 99% of budget TVs in the market can\'t produce the contrast you\'d expect out of DV content anyways, so why care. You get HDR, and HDR content is definitely better looking than non-HDR ones in terms of colors and vibrancy. I planned to use the TV without cable, but the TV does come with some channels like Republic TV, Bloomberg, 9XM, etc., these stream in 1080p, so a great bonus to have.Remote:Very basic RF remote, unlike Bluetooth ones on most new TVs. The remote\'s looks pretty sleek and stylish, but that\'s about it. Biggest gripe - typing to search for things within apps is a pain in the behind, you\'ll need to use the D-pad to navigate on an on-screen keyboard. You can control the TV using Samsung\'s SmartThings App, but guess what - you can\'t even use your phone\'s keyboard to type in when controlling through the app - this is something that can be added through an update, but it\'s not there yet.Attached pictures are all of 4K content. Resolution might get scaled down after I submit the review, but you can still get an idea of the TV\'s design/looks, Panel colors and contrast, etc.I\'d say I\'m really happy - and given the chance, wouldn\'t change my decision. It\'s a Samsung TV, so end of the day, if it produces a decent picture, and lasts a couple of years more than I expect, I can overlook all other cons. I\'d highly recommend the TV if you have the same expectations from your next TV.\nRead more', "\n\n\n\n\n                    The media could not be loaded.\n                \n\n\n\n\xa0I recently took the plunge into the world of smart TVs, starting with the Samsung i Smart Cue60 model from Amazon. At first, everything seemed peachy keen, but my excitement quickly plummeted when I discovered four pesky dead pixels just a few days into the TV affair. Kudos to Amazon's customer service, though—they swooped in with efficiency after my distress call. Despite the pixel debacle, they swiftly processed my refund, leaving me both grateful and TV-less. Undeterred, I decided to give it another shot and turned to Flipkart for a second act, choosing the Samsung Cue70 model with its promising Assistant feature. Well, fate had a different script for me this time. Lo and behold, I unwrapped a used TV with questionable packaging and a rather prominent dead pixel. Frustrated with the cycle of returns, I sought advice from a tech-savvy friend who nonchalantly informed me that dead pixels are the norm in LED TVs. Armed with a two-year warranty, I decided to keep the TV, throwing caution to the wind. I even opted for an extra year of coverage, playing the long game. Whether this gamble pays off or not is a cliffhanger in itself. As I embark on this uncertain TV journey, I feel compelled to warn potential buyers of the Cue60 and Cue70 models—brace yourselves for the dead pixel roulette; chances are, you might find yourself spinning the wheel. For the rest of us, let's not sweat the small stuff—these are just materialistic things. Life has more important matters to offer. Here's to staying calm and embracing the uncertainties of the electronic world! Cheers to a pixel-perfect future or not. \nRead more", "\nLikes:1. Display quality is good2. Audio depth is good3.

I was told AUE60 & AUE70(the models listed here as Crystal 4K and 4K Pro) are E-commerce exclusive models, not available offline. I was shown AU7700 which has the same processor, panel and features, but was listed at 65K for the 55" version. I liked the picture quality, and decided I\'ll get the AUE60 since it shares so much with AU7700, and save ~20k.Why I went for AUE60  vs. AUE70 - I knew I wouldn\'t be needing a voice assistant, and wanted to save 3k. I knew even if I wanted a voice assistant, I could plug in Fire TV/Mi TV box and get those features later on. Delivery was pretty hassle free, the delivery executive unloaded the TV in the room I asked for, and opened the box to inspect the TV for any physical damages. Samsung technicians came in a few hours later, installed and gave a demo.Sound:Per other reviews - sound from speakers is apparently bad, but in my case, I found it satisfactory. I have it wall mounted in a 10X12ft room, and the TV\'s speakers sound better compared to Bose Soundlink Speakers that I connected it to via Bluetooth.Picture:The Panel\'s great, but nothing worth raving about.

Vu Gloled has better sound quality compare to vu Cinema tv models. but still needs improvement in sound quality.-Picture Quality is good. Panel brightness is 400 nits (very high) just need to set backlight to 50% to reduce eyes strain. Colors production is good.  HD, 4K Content looks very nice, if you are OTT user you will enjoy the picture quality but if you are using Set Top box SD Channels quality may disappoint you, this TV enhance the SD quality.- I preferred this tv over samsung as Samsung has Tizen OS and you don't get much apps there you get Google play store and lots of apps to install.- Sound Quality Vu still needs some improvement in sound, Sound is improved compared to previous vu models but it misses the clarity.Overall I am satisfied with the purchase.\nRead more", '\nPROS :PICTUREExcellent Panel Quality. The VU GLOLED 50 INCH Panel Quality is extremely good . The display is extremely bright panel for a 50 inch 4K TV and it has one of the best brightness levels in its category. The Colour Science of the Panel is slightly tuned towards the LG colour science . The panel support Dolby Vision /  HDR10 / HDR10+ as well as HLG video formats and watching the content on OTT apps is amazing. The default colour setting was little oversaturated to my liking but VU Gloled gives ample setting to tweak and adjust the same.  The TV comes with features like MEMC ( Motion Enhancement ) by default and the settings can be tweaked separately for each source ( HD Content / Dolby Vision Content / HDR10 / HDR10+ ) . The panel is manufactured by OEM Hisense and the quality is on par with the A6H/A7H. It is one of the best budget panels in the market. The viewing angels are also good unless you want to watch the TV from the extreme ends which will result in some color differences which makes me believe the Panel is a high quality VA panelSPEAKERS :The VU Gloled has a good sound quality when compared to the general sound quality . The best part is the sub woofer is inbuilt with bottom firing speakers. If we do not go by the 104W expectation the speakers do a decent job and its better than what the normal tv in the price range offers. If you do not want to invest or interested in a soundbar and you want a TV with good sound quality this TV is the best suited for you . Also the sub woofer can be turned off in the settings if you are not interested . Also there are ample  of settings for the sound tweaking as well and you can tweak it to your preference.  Also Dolby ATMOS support works well with the TVInstallation :The Wall Mounts and stand  are provided in the box. The assembly was done by Amazon at the time of delivery itself so I did not have any issues . The packaging and installation done by the Amazon team was good without issuesAccessories:The TV comes with all the ports required as well as the Remote . The remoteless far field mic works well . The Remote has ample buttons with dedicated hot keys for all the favourite OTT apps as well. The find my remote functionality enables you to find the remote if it is lost which is a really useful feature.OS / HardwareThe processor as shown in AIDA64 is m7632 . Processor is Mediatek MT9612 . It is 4 cores Cortex A55 @ 1500 MHz & GPU is Mali G52 GPU .The processor is one of the better processors for TV and comes with support for latest video codes like AV1. Mother Board codename is his9612 .  RAM is 1790 MB & Storage is 16GB out of which around half is already consumed by Google TV. Most of preinstalled OTT apps can be uninstalled except some like Youtube.  Google TV takes around 35 to 40 seconds to boot up and the OS is better than the Android TV OS . The Google TV mobile app makes controlling the TV and typing ridiculously easy and the  Voice search is now across all the apps / system wide . Google Apps can be installed and you can also install 3rd party apps.  Google OS is basically better version of old Android TV Version.After Sales Service / Extended WarrantyVU offers additional 2 years comprehensive warranty from their website.  If  looking for a long term purchase I would highly recommend getting the official extended warranty from their website. The customer care team was really helpful while extending the warranty and the timelines were followed. You can check the warranty online on their website.Area for Improvement : No updates apart from the Google OS bi-monthly new feature rollouts. The VU team must also look to provide updates to the GLOLED lineup .Cons : With bluetooth headphones connected, the sound is comparatively  lower . Seems to  a common issue across units and it must be a software bug which could be fixed if VU provides an update.Overall Conclusion : If you are looking for a 4K 50 inch TV with good Panel quality  , good sound quality and better customer support than some other competitors  in a budget this is a must buy TV for you . This is definitely one of the best TV in its price segment and you cannot go wrong with it .\nRead more', '\nI\'m writing review after 6 months of purchase..My overall experience for the 43 INCH VU TV is good in terms of viewing angle, Sound experience and picture quality. I loved the Dolby feature .. You can customise your tv based on your tatse as it has lot more options.I liked the remote features pretty much to navigate to the suggested apps pretty quickly in one single tap. However in the past two months the batteries in the remote were liquidied in the remote ineffective which the picture is getting changed between cinematic & standard mode.After consulting through VU technician they\'ve advised us to use ONLY "ALKALINE BATTERIES" from Duracell which will last longer and remote consumes more power.Apart from the everything is smooth & good. Interesting fact is if remote doesn\'t work you can use google home feature to control your tv.All other features are well and good.\nRead more', '\nMost value for money product and very reliable service and support\nRead more', '\nThe picture quality is too good in VU\nRead more', "\nProsWriting this review after few days of usePicture quality is excellent.

It doesn't shy away from addressing complex issues, and it encourages viewers to think critically and engage with the material on a deeper level.In summary, Sony is an absolute triumph. It's a thought-provoking, emotionally resonant, and visually captivating series that deserves all the accolades it receives. If you're in search of a TV show that will keep you on the edge of your seat and leave you with much to ponder, don't miss this gem. It's a binge-worthy experience that will stay with you long after the credits roll.\nRead more", "\nI recently purchased the Sony x64l 50-inch during the Diwali sales. I'm pleased with the product. The picture quality is amazing and the Dolby Atmos sound enhances the viewing experience.The TV is user-friendly, but I've noticed that it takes a bit too much time to turn on and opening apps can be a bit sluggish, especially after owning it for 2 weeks. This delay, sometimes more than a minute, can be a minor inconvenience.While the design is decent, I've found the overall performance to be a little slow. An update to improve the speed of opening apps and navigating the TV interface would be greatly appreciated.Unfortunately, I encountered issues with screen casting; it simply did not work on this TV. Additionally, the integration with PS5 is not available, which might disappoint gaming enthusiasts. I also faced difficulties downloading some apps.In summary, the Sony x64l offers excellent picture and sound quality, but it could benefit from a faster performance through updates. The absence of functional screen casting, limited app downloads and lack of PS5 integration are drawbacks worth considering.\nRead more", '\nHi..Recently fir diwali fest i  bought new 55 inch x74k Tv...Its Pitcure Quality is Awesome Sound Quality is crystal clear  No need of soundbar etc..Upscaling of sd channels also good.Must go for it...if you are looking to purchase...tv....(Actual Price Rs.53000+ on amazon got discount from icici bank Rs5k and from Amazon 5k and got it for just 42k)All the best..\nRead more', '\nI got this tv for 37k.Pros:1) display is best2) build quality is good3) 4k video quality is good (upscaling is also good )4) Speakers are best5) side viewing angles are good6) voice recognition is so accurate.Cons :1) booting up takes little longer (expected from Google tv)2) some times ui is laggy3) Ram management should be improved\nRead more', '\n10 days update :1.

Blades are really sharp and It trims all body hair very well. The head of the trimmer can be adjusted using the rotary dial to trim the hair very fine or very coarse as per your preference.CONS;- Not water-proof; but not expected to be waterproof at this price point- Not sharp enough to trim hard beards (might still work on the softer ones); but it is better suited for body hair; if you want a dedicated beard trimmer, you should explore other options.A good product at this price that justifies its purchase.Should you go for it? YES.\nRead more', '\nNice product\nRead more', '\nNot durable\nRead more', "\nThe build quality is fine. Nothing to rave about, but nothing to complain about either.However, the trimming is excellent! It gives you very even hair length.I have been using it every alternate day now for 3 weeks, and no complains so far.Very happy that I bought it. Three big reasons for that:1. The barber/salon near my place always has a lot of customers. So, a trip for getting your hair/beard done takes around 1.5 hours as your turn will come after 2-3 customersThis often resulted in me getting lazy and having untrimmed beard for 2-3 weeks.With this trimmer, I can do it myself at home. And since I use it every alternate day, I don't have to spend more than 5-10 minutes per sessionStorage. So, now I am much more presentable eery day.2. I can trim it to any length I want,..and if not satisfied, trim it a tad more again.3. Goes without saying, it is a very big plus during COVID situation.Pros:1. The biggest plus will have to be the excellent trimming quality and fine precise controls.2. Battery runtime seems to be good till now. Runs for 1.5 hrs as mentioned. In fact, I have had to charge it only thrice till now (about 3 weeks)3. Charging time is pleasantly low. I didn't time it precisely, but it surely charges well under 2 hours.4. Head is washable.5. Can be used in cord-ed as well as cordless modes.6. Doesn't heat up noticably.Cons:1. Not a big one, but just for the sake of completeness, I feel there should be a better mechanism for detaching the head. A push button of some sorts.The current way is to apply sufficient pressure wth your thumb against the blade to click it open. With this approach, there is a slight risk of getting a cut on your fingers, if you are not careful.Also, I sometimes wonder whether applying a bit extra pressure might bend the blade. THis suspicion might be unfounded, but it is what it is.2. The website to register your warranty has a medicore built. This along with the absence of information about service centres, or customer care numbers, inspire very little confidence about the after-purscase service. The makers should make that information more prominently available, because lack of it might be turning away a lot of potential buyers.Other than this small con, I think it is a great buy.

Here's my review:Pros:Excellent Performance: The trimmer's cutting performance is impressive. It effortlessly trims both hair and beard, giving clean and precise results. The blades are sharp and offer a smooth trimming experience.Cordless Convenience: The cordless design allows for freedom of movement and ease of use. It's convenient for grooming on the go and eliminates the hassle of tangled cords.Solid Build Quality: The trimmer feels sturdy and well-built. It seems durable and capable of withstanding regular use.Versatile Attachments: The included comb attachments offer a range of cutting lengths, making it suitable for different grooming styles and preferences.Easy to Clean: The detachable blade makes cleaning the trimmer a breeze. It can be quickly rinsed under running water, ensuring hygiene and maintaining performance.Cons:Battery Life: The battery life could be improved. Although it lasts for a reasonable amount of time, it may require more frequent charging, especially for longer grooming sessions.Noisy Operation: The trimmer tends to be a bit noisy during use. While it doesn't affect the performance, it can be slightly distracting.Overall, the Kubra KB-2028 Cordless Hair Trimmer for Men/Beard Trimmer for Men offers reliable performance, delivering precise results and convenience. Despite the minor drawbacks of battery life and noise, its solid build quality and versatility make it a worthy grooming companion.Note: This review is based on hypothetical information since I don't have specific knowledge about the Kubra KB-2028 Cordless Hair Trimmer.

I was told AUE60 & AUE70(the models listed here as Crystal 4K and 4K Pro) are E-commerce exclusive models, not available offline. I was shown AU7700 which has the same processor, panel and features, but was listed at 65K for the 55" version. I liked the picture quality, and decided I\'ll get the AUE60 since it shares so much with AU7700, and save ~20k.Why I went for AUE60  vs. AUE70 - I knew I wouldn\'t be needing a voice assistant, and wanted to save 3k. I knew even if I wanted a voice assistant, I could plug in Fire TV/Mi TV box and get those features later on. Delivery was pretty hassle free, the delivery executive unloaded the TV in the room I asked for, and opened the box to inspect the TV for any physical damages. Samsung technicians came in a few hours later, installed and gave a demo.Sound:Per other reviews - sound from speakers is apparently bad, but in my case, I found it satisfactory. I have it wall mounted in a 10X12ft room, and the TV\'s speakers sound better compared to Bose Soundlink Speakers that I connected it to via Bluetooth.Picture:The Panel\'s great, but nothing worth raving about. Gray uniformity isn\'t great(i.e. gray tones won\'t be perfectly uniform across the whole panel, there\'ll be darker zones towards the edges/corners based on backlight placement). Blacks aren\'t perfectly black - and they\'re brighter than you\'d expect from a VA panel, but this isn\'t noticeable at all when the room is lit. No backlight bleed. Colors are as good as I\'d like them to be, and the panel does get noticeably bright for my taste, even when brightness is turned down to 40%. 720p content is watchable from >8ft, 1080p is good(I\'d say better than I expected), and 4K is well, 4K.Connectivity:I have a 35 Mb/s broadband  connection and all content streams in 4K when available, without stutters. The TV has Bluetooth 5.0, and works with TWS and Neckband earphones fine(I use Oppo Enco W51 and Boat Rockerz 330) - there\'s no noticeable latency, and volume can be controlled through the remote itself.Apps & Features:Has all the standard slew of streaming apps I needed - Netflix, Hotstar, Prime, Apple TV+ & YouTube. All of them stream 4k content, except for Hotstar - which only streamed 4K a few times. 1080p is still very watchable, and not really a deal breaker. No Dolby Vision support - which I made my peace with considering the fact that 99% of budget TVs in the market can\'t produce the contrast you\'d expect out of DV content anyways, so why care. You get HDR, and HDR content is definitely better looking than non-HDR ones in terms of colors and vibrancy. I planned to use the TV without cable, but the TV does come with some channels like Republic TV, Bloomberg, 9XM, etc., these stream in 1080p, so a great bonus to have.Remote:Very basic RF remote, unlike Bluetooth ones on most new TVs. The remote\'s looks pretty sleek and stylish, but that\'s about it. Biggest gripe - typing to search for things within apps is a pain in the behind, you\'ll need to use the D-pad to navigate on an on-screen keyboard. You can control the TV using Samsung\'s SmartThings App, but guess what - you can\'t even use your phone\'s keyboard to type in when controlling through the app - this is something that can be added through an update, but it\'s not there yet.Attached pictures are all of 4K content. Resolution might get scaled down after I submit the review, but you can still get an idea of the TV\'s design/looks, Panel colors and contrast, etc.I\'d say I\'m really happy - and given the chance, wouldn\'t change my decision. It\'s a Samsung TV, so end of the day, if it produces a decent picture, and lasts a couple of years more than I expect, I can overlook all other cons. I\'d highly recommend the TV if you have the same expectations from your next TV.\nRead more', "\n\n\n\n\n                    The media could not be loaded.\n                \n\n\n\n\xa0I recently took the plunge into the world of smart TVs, starting with the Samsung i Smart Cue60 model from Amazon. At first, everything seemed peachy keen, but my excitement quickly plummeted when I discovered four pesky dead pixels just a few days into the TV affair. Kudos to Amazon's customer service, though—they swooped in with efficiency after my distress call. Despite the pixel debacle, they swiftly processed my refund, leaving me both grateful and TV-less. Undeterred, I decided to give it another shot and turned to Flipkart for a second act, choosing the Samsung Cue70 model with its promising Assistant feature. Well, fate had a different script for me this time. Lo and behold, I unwrapped a used TV with questionable packaging and a rather prominent dead pixel. Frustrated with the cycle of returns, I sought advice from a tech-savvy friend who nonchalantly informed me that dead pixels are the norm in LED TVs. Armed with a two-year warranty, I decided to keep the TV, throwing caution to the wind. I even opted for an extra year of coverage, playing the long game. Whether this gamble pays off or not is a cliffhanger in itself. As I embark on this uncertain TV journey, I feel compelled to warn potential buyers of the Cue60 and Cue70 models—brace yourselves for the dead pixel roulette; chances are, you might find yourself spinning the wheel. For the rest of us, let's not sweat the small stuff—these are just materialistic things. Life has more important matters to offer. Here's to staying calm and embracing the uncertainties of the electronic world! Cheers to a pixel-perfect future or not. \nRead more", "\nLikes:1. Display quality is good2. Audio depth is good3.

I was told AUE60 & AUE70(the models listed here as Crystal 4K and 4K Pro) are E-commerce exclusive models, not available offline. I was shown AU7700 which has the same processor, panel and features, but was listed at 65K for the 55" version. I liked the picture quality, and decided I\'ll get the AUE60 since it shares so much with AU7700, and save ~20k.Why I went for AUE60  vs. AUE70 - I knew I wouldn\'t be needing a voice assistant, and wanted to save 3k. I knew even if I wanted a voice assistant, I could plug in Fire TV/Mi TV box and get those features later on. Delivery was pretty hassle free, the delivery executive unloaded the TV in the room I asked for, and opened the box to inspect the TV for any physical damages. Samsung technicians came in a few hours later, installed and gave a demo.Sound:Per other reviews - sound from speakers is apparently bad, but in my case, I found it satisfactory. I have it wall mounted in a 10X12ft room, and the TV\'s speakers sound better compared to Bose Soundlink Speakers that I connected it to via Bluetooth.Picture:The Panel\'s great, but nothing worth raving about. Gray uniformity isn\'t great(i.e. gray tones won\'t be perfectly uniform across the whole panel, there\'ll be darker zones towards the edges/corners based on backlight placement). Blacks aren\'t perfectly black - and they\'re brighter than you\'d expect from a VA panel, but this isn\'t noticeable at all when the room is lit. No backlight bleed. Colors are as good as I\'d like them to be, and the panel does get noticeably bright for my taste, even when brightness is turned down to 40%. 720p content is watchable from >8ft, 1080p is good(I\'d say better than I expected), and 4K is well, 4K.Connectivity:I have a 35 Mb/s broadband  connection and all content streams in 4K when available, without stutters. The TV has Bluetooth 5.0, and works with TWS and Neckband earphones fine(I use Oppo Enco W51 and Boat Rockerz 330) - there\'s no noticeable latency, and volume can be controlled through the remote itself.Apps & Features:Has all the standard slew of streaming apps I needed - Netflix, Hotstar, Prime, Apple TV+ & YouTube. All of them stream 4k content, except for Hotstar - which only streamed 4K a few times. 1080p is still very watchable, and not really a deal breaker. No Dolby Vision support - which I made my peace with considering the fact that 99% of budget TVs in the market can\'t produce the contrast you\'d expect out of DV content anyways, so why care. You get HDR, and HDR content is definitely better looking than non-HDR ones in terms of colors and vibrancy. I planned to use the TV without cable, but the TV does come with some channels like Republic TV, Bloomberg, 9XM, etc., these stream in 1080p, so a great bonus to have.Remote:Very basic RF remote, unlike Bluetooth ones on most new TVs. The remote\'s looks pretty sleek and stylish, but that\'s about it. Biggest gripe - typing to search for things within apps is a pain in the behind, you\'ll need to use the D-pad to navigate on an on-screen keyboard. You can control the TV using Samsung\'s SmartThings App, but guess what - you can\'t even use your phone\'s keyboard to type in when controlling through the app - this is something that can be added through an update, but it\'s not there yet.Attached pictures are all of 4K content. Resolution might get scaled down after I submit the review, but you can still get an idea of the TV\'s design/looks, Panel colors and contrast, etc.I\'d say I\'m really happy - and given the chance, wouldn\'t change my decision. It\'s a Samsung TV, so end of the day, if it produces a decent picture, and lasts a couple of years more than I expect, I can overlook all other cons. I\'d highly recommend the TV if you have the same expectations from your next TV.\nRead more', "\n\n\n\n\n                    The media could not be loaded.\n                \n\n\n\n\xa0I recently took the plunge into the world of smart TVs, starting with the Samsung i Smart Cue60 model from Amazon. At first, everything seemed peachy keen, but my excitement quickly plummeted when I discovered four pesky dead pixels just a few days into the TV affair. Kudos to Amazon's customer service, though—they swooped in with efficiency after my distress call. Despite the pixel debacle, they swiftly processed my refund, leaving me both grateful and TV-less. Undeterred, I decided to give it another shot and turned to Flipkart for a second act, choosing the Samsung Cue70 model with its promising Assistant feature. Well, fate had a different script for me this time. Lo and behold, I unwrapped a used TV with questionable packaging and a rather prominent dead pixel. Frustrated with the cycle of returns, I sought advice from a tech-savvy friend who nonchalantly informed me that dead pixels are the norm in LED TVs. Armed with a two-year warranty, I decided to keep the TV, throwing caution to the wind. I even opted for an extra year of coverage, playing the long game. Whether this gamble pays off or not is a cliffhanger in itself. As I embark on this uncertain TV journey, I feel compelled to warn potential buyers of the Cue60 and Cue70 models—brace yourselves for the dead pixel roulette; chances are, you might find yourself spinning the wheel. For the rest of us, let's not sweat the small stuff—these are just materialistic things. Life has more important matters to offer. Here's to staying calm and embracing the uncertainties of the electronic world! Cheers to a pixel-perfect future or not. \nRead more", "\nLikes:1. Display quality is good2. Audio depth is good3.
